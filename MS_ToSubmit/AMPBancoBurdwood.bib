  abstract = {Neritic fronts are very abundant in austral South America, covering several scales of space and time. However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile\textendash Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.},

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

La biodiversidad es ampliamente utilizada como indicadora del funcionamiento del ecosistema y, se ha comprobado, que sitios con mayor diversidad pueden ser m\'as resistentes a cambios ambientales. Esto implica conservar el funcionamiento del  ecosistema, lo cual puede evaluarse a trav\'es del flujo de energ\'ia y la  producci\'on de  biomasa.  En  un escenario de cambio clim\'atico como el que actualmente enfrenta el planeta, este flujo es a\'un m\'as relevante debido a que es proporcional a la materia org\'anica que se produce en el ecosistema, pudiendo generar sitios que almacenen alta cantidad de carbono. Dicha  inmovilizaci\'on del  C  fuera del atm\'osfera se considera un servicio ecosist\'emico, ya que ayuda a mitigar  los efectos del cambio clim\'atico global. Por esto, el presente estudio tiene como objetivo, evaluar la biodiversidad y estimar  el contenido de carbono, del bentos del \'Area Marina Protegida (AMP) Namuncur\'a- Banco Burdwood (BB) y compararlo con el Canal Beagle (CB). Los resultados sugieren que el BB posee mayor riqueza de especies y mayor biomasa que el CB (t = -4,54 - p = 0,025 y t = -4,69 - p = 0,002 respectivamente) y, adem\'as, almacena mayor cantidad de carbono (t = -4,82 - p = 0,001). Por otro lado, no se encontraron diferencias significativas entre la Zona N\'ucleo (ZN) y el \'area no incluida en \'esta (N ZN) en estas variables (p {$>$} 0,05 en todos los casos).

  abstract = {Food chains are short, rarely more than five trophic levels long. The cause of this pattern remains unresolved, and no current hypothesis fully explains this phenomenon. We offer an explanation based on the stability of food chains that have been shifted away from linearity to be more web-like. We start with a simple example of food webs of two to six species arranged so that species consume all those with a trophic level less than their own. The probability of stability, for such ``universal omnivory'' chains declined strongly with chain length, and was as low as 1\% with six level chains but highest for two and three level chains. We further explored the influence of chain length on food web stability by testing food webs with varying levels of connectance that were constructed either randomly or with the niche model. By additionally altering the relative impacts of predators on prey, and vice-versa, we test the role of our assumptions on the relationship between chain length and stability. Food webs characterized by low to moderate degrees of connectance, asymmetrical interactions, and relatively weak density dependence showed a pattern of reduced stability with longer trophic chains. The simple view that food webs characterized by long trophic chains are less stable seems to resolve the long-standing question of why there are so few trophic levels in nature.},

  abstract = {Many different concepts have been used to describe species' roles in food webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of ``gray areas'' between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

This study evaluated for the first time the occurrence of microplastics in benthic organisms from the Marine Protected Area Namuncur\'a at Burdwood Bank, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Microplastics were isolated from the soft tissue of the sea stars Henricia obesa and Odontaster penicillatus using an oxidative treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The chemical composition of the particles was identified with Raman spectroscopy. Fibers and fragments were found in similar proportions in both species. Fibers were identified as semi-synthetic cellulose, while the polymeric composition of fragments was masked by the synthetic pigment Phthalo blue. Over half of the sea stars contained microplastics (61\%). In H. obesa, the mean abundance was 1.00\,{$\pm$}\,1.03 particles per individual and 3.34\,{$\pm$}\,4.13 particles per gram, and in O. penicillatus, the mean abundance was 2.70\,{$\pm$}\,2.91 particles per individual and 1.94\,{$\pm$}\,2.09 particles per gram. Fibers were predominantly blue, and all fragments were bluish/turquoise. Microplastic sizes ranged from 24 to 1340~\textmu m, and most particles (approximately 90\%) were less than 1~mm. These results provide a baseline assessment of the abundance and type of microplastics in benthic organisms from this sub-Antarctic protected area and contribute to the scant data on microplastic pollution in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

The main contribution of this work was to explore fish species composition and the structure of fish assemblages in three different zones of the MPAN-BB with different conservation strategies and different surrounding areas. Twenty-two fishing trawls were performed using a demersal bottom trawl pilot net at depths between 71 and 608~m. A total of 667 fish belonging to 30 species were collected in the surveyed area. The richest family in terms of species number was Nototheniidae (seven species), followed by Macrouridae, Myxinidae and Zoarcidae (four species each), then Moridae and Arhynchobatidae (three species each), and finally Muraenolepididae and Psychrolutidae (two species each). The remaining families were represented by a single species. Three significantly different fish assemblages were detected. These distinct assemblages were largely circumscribed at the plateau, the shelf-break slope, and the area west of the BB. The results showed that fish diversity in the MPAN-BB is relatively high constituting\,\textasciitilde\,10\% of the fish composition reported for the Atlantic sector of the Magellanic Province. The present data suggest that fishes are an important component of the benthic community planned to be protected by the implementation of the MPAN-BB. These findings have important implications for habitat preservation and threatened species conservation.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

This study makes progress in this direction, describing the most recent advances in marine conservation in Chile and analysing the contribution of the different conservation instruments as well as the distribution of designated areas across ecoregions. Furthermore, it examines the potential contribution of alternative area-based instruments to balance ocean protection. The advances observed in Chile were compared among four South American countries and five leading countries in ocean conservation, analysing protection levels in coastal areas, continental exclusive economic zones, and overseas territories. Data on MPA boundaries and attributes were sourced from the World Database on Protected Areas and complemented the official information on MPAs and territorial user rights for fisheries and for indigenous people in South America. The current level of protection in Chile is among the highest in the world in area coverage and in the proportion of the continental exclusive economic zone assigned to fully protected areas. However, it exhibits the strongest imbalances in the distribution of designated MPAs between coastal and oceanic waters, in comparison with the leading countries and also within South America (Per\'u, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay), and among ecoregions. The patterns observed suggest that Chile has advanced, but concentrated, conservation efforts in low-threat, remote ecoregions. There is an urgent need to progress towards high-threat ecoregions, which implies balancing the needs of nature and people. The distribution of ancillary conservation instruments can help double the level of protection in threatened coastal areas, filling gaps in marine conservation and creating an opportunity to progress and diversify conservation strategies.},

However, information regarding S. fuegensis in the Namuncur\'a Marine Protected Area\textendash Burdwood Bank (NMPA\textendash BB), an open sea Sub-Antarctic Marine Protected Area located in the Argentinian shelf, is outdated and fragmented. Understanding the dynamics of species inhabiting the NMPA\textendash BB is relevant to establish future adequate management strategies. We assessed the abundance, size, and development of S. fuegensis early life stages during spring, summer, and autumn in order to evaluate their seasonal patterns. Compared to neighboring areas, S. fuegensis was particularly abundant in the NMPA\textendash BB, which can be considered a major spawning and nursery ground. Within the NMPA\textendash BB, abundances tend to be higher at the center, probably as a result of the marine currents. Eggs were only recorded in spring, while larvae were recorded in all seasons sampled, with maximum abundances occurring during spring. Larger larval sizes and more developed stages occurred in summer and autumn. Analysis of otolith microstructure showed that spawning periods take place between October and March, peaking in November. Slow growth rates (maximum of 0.30~mm~day-1) and prolonged larval phase would respond to the low temperatures recorded in the NMPA\textendash BB. Additionally, marked monthly differences in otolith growth would suggest a seasonal effect on the developmental patterns of S. fuegensis larvae. Future studies will be necessary to completely understand S. fuegensis development and determine its trophic role in the NMPA\textendash BB.},

This region is characterized by high biological productivity, and by an exceptional tidal regime that interacts with the subpolar Falkland/Malvinas (FM) current. The results presented contribute to the development of an ecohydrodynamic system intended for the study of the implications of increasing exploitation of natural resources in the region. Detailed tidal charts show the propagation on the continental shelf of tidal waves related to clockwise amphidromes in the South Atlantic, indicating the occurrence of resonance. The averaged velocity field is dominated by the FM current, although tidal residuals around headlands are significant on the Patagonian coast. In contrast, ``snapshots'' describe the interaction between the tides and the FM current, where the flow patterns displayed are expected to influence the population dynamics of biological species. The mean wind stress induces strong currents and a large anticlockwise circulation cell northeast of Tierra del Fuego. The strong tidal and FM currents generate shelf sea fronts whose locations, revealed by contours of the Simpson-Hunter parameter, are related to major fishing grounds. Because of the lack of velocity measurements in the region, the FM and wind-driven currents simulated by the model should be taken as experimental results until proper comparisons with observations can be made.},

The upper 500 meters regime along the shelf break and around Malvinas Islands (48\textdegree{} to 55\textdegree{} S) is analyzed. In particular, the 1994 horizontal distribution of temperature, salinity and density was mapped in order to show the extreme winter pattern of these parameters. Three salinity sections crossing the water flow direction in the Malvinas Channel (South to the islands) were selected to describe the vertical stratification 1995 and 1995. Horizontal and vertical distribution of chlorophyll a from the 1995 cruise is presented as reference data, considering the lack of information on this parameter for the area. Finally, the inter-annual variability of the heat content in two 5\textdegree{} x 5\textdegree{} areas (East and West to the islands) is discussed by comparing the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data between the four sampled years. From this information, 1995 resulted in the coolest winter, presenting a temperature anomaly around -4\textdegree{} C respect to the other winters.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules4,5 in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a `cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks6,7,8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

The Burdwood Bank (BB) is a submerged plateau (average depth 100 m) that constitutes the westernmost segment of the North Scotia Ridge (54\textdegree\textendash 55\textdegree S; 56\textdegree\textendash 62\textdegree W). The BB hosts rich benthic biodiversity in low chlorophyll waters of the southern Patagonian Shelf, Argentina, declared Namuncur\'a Marine Protected Area (NMPA) in 2013. So far, the pelagic microorganisms above the bank have not been described. During austral summer 2016, we assessed the microbial plankton (0.2\textendash 200 {$\mu$}m cell size) biomass and their taxonomical and functional diversity along a longitudinal transect (54.2\textendash 55.3\textdegree S, 58\textendash 68\textdegree W) from the Beagle Channel (BC) to the BB, characterized by contrasting hydrography. Results displayed a marked zonation in the composition and structure of the microbial communities. The biomass of phytoplankton {$>$}5 {$\mu$}m was 28 times higher in the BC, attributed mainly to large diatom blooms, than in oceanic waters above the BB, where the small coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and flagellates {$<$}10 {$\mu$}m dominated. In turn, the biomass of microheterotrophs above the BB doubled the biomass in the BC due to large ciliates. Notably, toxic phytoplankton species and their phycotoxins were detected, in particular high abundance of Dinophysis acuminata and pectenotoxins above the bank, highlighting their presence in open subpolar regions. Picophytoplankton ({$<$}2 {$\mu$}m), including Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, were remarkably important above the BB, both at surface and deep waters (up to 150 m). Their biomass surpassed by 5 times that of phytoplankton {$>$} 5 {$\mu$}m, emphasizing the importance of small-sized phytoplankton in low chlorophyll waters. The homogeneous water column and high retention above the bank seem to favor the development of abundant picophytoplankton and microzooplankton communities. Overall, our findings unfold the plankton configuration in the Southern Patagonian Shelf, ascribed as a sink for anthropogenic CO2, and highlight the diverse ecological traits that microorganisms develop to adjust their yield to changing conditions.},

In response marine protected areas (MPAs) have increasingly been adopted as the flagship approach to marine conservation, many covering enormous areas. At present, however, the lack of biological sampling makes prioritising which regions of the ocean to protect, especially over large spatial scales, particularly problematic. Here we present an interdisciplinary approach to marine landscape mapping at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia as an effective protocol for underpinning large-scale (105\textendash 106 \,km2) MPA designations. We have developed a new high-resolution (100\,m) digital elevation model (DEM) of the region and integrated this DEM with bathymetry-derived parameters, modelled oceanographic data, and satellite primary productivity data. These interdisciplinary datasets were used to apply an objective statistical approach to hierarchically partition and map the benthic environment into physical habitats types. We assess the potential application of physical habitat classifications as proxies for biological structuring and the application of the landscape mapping for informing on marine spatial planning.},

Since species are components of food webs, one way to conceptualize and quantify species importance is from a network perspective. The importance of a species can be quantified by measuring the centrality of its position in a food web, because a central node may have greater influence on others in the network. A species may also be important because it has a unique network position, such that its loss cannot be easily compensated. Therefore, for a food web to be robust, we hypothesize that central species must be functionally redundant in terms of their network position. In this paper, we test our hypothesis by analysing the Prince William Sound ecosystem. We found that species centrality and uniqueness are negatively correlated, and such an observation is also carried over to other food webs.},

Symbioses between bryozoans and pagurid crabs are known from a wide latitudinal range, including tropical, warm- and cold-temperate regions. Here we describe Burdwoodipora paguricola gen. et sp. nov., a cheilostome bryozoan associated with pagurized shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus comptus White in subantarctic waters of the Southwest Atlantic. The association seems to be obligate, as the bryozoan was always found enlarging the last whorl of its gastropod substrate. The new species, however, is not species specific with regard to its shell substrate, as it was found to be associated with 31 species of gastropods with helicoidal coiling. Well-developed colonies may project up to 360\textdegree{} from the outer lip of the shell. The chamber built by the bryozoan is usually larger than the whorl that would have been generated by the gastropod. This is one of the few known cases of an obligate association between a bryozoan and a pagurid crab outside the ascophoran family Hippoporidridae and is also the first bryozoan/hermit crab symbiosis documented in the subantarctic region. The inclusion of Burdwoodipora in the Pacificincolidae, a family currently represented by just four species from the Northern Hemisphere, is discussed.},

This scaling contradicts the widely accepted link-species scaling law, which asserts that links increase linearly with the number of species and that the link-species exponent is one. My results combined with related findings regarding food chain lengths indicate that large food webs have many more links and much longer food chains than previously suggested.}

Model analysis shows energetic upwelling and mixing uplifting deep and benthic waters into the photic layer. Tides and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are the primary drivers of the bank's circulation. Tidal forcing is the main driver for the entrainment of deep waters into the upper layers of the bank and local wind forcing for the detrainment of these waters into the deep ocean. Passive tracer diagnostics suggest that the dynamical processes triggered by the Burdwood Bank could have a significant impact on local ecosystems and the biogeochemical balance of the southwestern Atlantic region, which is one of the most fertile portions of the Southern Ocean. Model results are robust\textemdash they are reproduced in a wide array of model configurations\textemdash but there is insufficient observational evidence to corroborate them. Satellite color imagery does not show substantial chlorophyll blooms in this region but it shows strong phytoplankton plumes emanating from the bank. There are several potential explanations for the chlorophyll deficit, including lack of light due to persistent cloud cover, deep mixing layers, fast ocean currents, and the likelihood that blooms, while extant, might not develop on the surface. None of these possibilities can be confirmed at this stage.},

Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

These major contributors to the low salinity intermediate water mass are advected northward along the continental slope of South America. The lower density water type enters the Argentine Basin both east and west of Burdwood Bank. Its thermohaline characteristics are modified by winter sea-air interaction near Burdwood Bank and mixing with the surrounding waters further north. The denser water type flows east of Burdwood Bank, undergoing salinity decrease, primarily by isopycnal processes. Low salinity water, derived from the Polar Front, is introduced into a still denser horizon (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}), from along the axis of the cyclonic circulation feature described by the Malvinas Current and its return to the south. The thermohaline structure across the Malvinas Current is similar to the water mass zonation observed in the northern Drake Passage. In the vicinity of 38\textdegree S, the northward-flowing modified subantarctic water converges with subtropical thermocline water at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. The less dense subantarctic water spreads under the subtropical thermocline; however, the denser water (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}) of Polar Front origin is not found under the subtropical thermocline in the western South Atlantic. In general the salinity at the salinity minimum increases rapidly across the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, suggesting that the bulk of the subantarctic water advected into the region by the Malvinas Current turns towards the interior, spreading under the subtropical thermocline along a broader expanse of the South Atlantic.},

This goal can be achieved in part by acquiring more detailed food web information and evaluating the processes that shape food web structure and dynamics. Our main objective was to identify large-scale patterns in the organization of pelagic food webs that can be linked to a wasp-waist (WW) structure, proposed for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. We evaluated 3 sub-Antarctic marine areas in a regional context: the Beagle Channel (BC), the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego (CA) and the oceanic Burdwood Bank area (BB). We used carbon and nitrogen isotopic information of all functional trophic groups, ranging from primary producers to top predators, and analyzed them through stable isotope-based Bayesian analyses. We found that BC and BB have a more pronounced WW structure compared to CA. We identified species at mid to low trophic positions that play a key role in the trophodynamics of each marine area (e.g. Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, longtail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi and squat lobster Munida gregaria) and considered them as the most plausible WW species. The identification of the most influential species within food webs has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean.},

  abstract = {Strong decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are required to meet the reduction trajectory resolved within the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent impacts of climate change: acidification, sea-level rise, intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-tech, cost-effective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future.},

  abstract = {The United Nations' target for global ocean protection is 10\% of the ocean in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) by 2020. There has been remarkable progress in the last decade, and some organizations claim that 7\% of the ocean is already protected and that we will exceed the 10\% target by 2020. However, currently only 3.6\% of the ocean is in implemented MPAs, and only 2\% is in implemented strongly or fully protected areas. Here we argue that current protection has been overestimated because it includes areas that are not yet protected, and that areas that allow significant extractive activities such as fishing should not count as `protected.' The most rigorous projections suggest that we will not achieve the 10\% target in truly protected areas by 2020. Strongly or fully protected areas are the only ones achieving the goal of protecting biodiversity; hence they should be the MPA of choice to achieve global ocean conservation targets.},

  abstract = {The first open-sea (non-coastal) Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Argentina was created in 2013 (and named ``Namuncur\'a''), at Burdwood Bank, an undersea plateau located about 200~km south from Malvinas/Falkland Islands, SW Atlantic Ocean. This contribution represents the most recent and complete checklist of benthic organisms (mainly mega and macrofauna) that summarized 240 taxa collected at three sites in the mentioned area. The benthic richness here documented largely exceeds the values coming from other productive areas in Argentinean waters. Faunistic composition was different among the sites, although several species were shared. Bryozoans presented the highest richness compared to the other groups, followed by mollusks and sponges. These data represent valuable information and a very helpful starting point for incoming research, conservation efforts and management. It is essential to establish the spatial distribution of indicator taxa, like corals, sponges and bryozoans, to better attempt at the protection of benthic biodiversity in this rich Argentinean marine system. This is a key issue considering the notable extension of the MPA compared to other areas in Argentina, the bathymetric variations, particular oceanographic conditions and different fishing circumstances within the area.},

Scleractinians were recorded only at three stations inside the marine protected area (MPA) Namuncur\'a I, while the majority of them were recorded deeper than 200 m. Burdwood Bank slope (MPA Namuncur\'a II + NW slope) was the richest sub-area, with ten species recorded in the present study and another two species mentioned from the literature. For the majority of the species the results here presented represent the only available data in the study area after 50 years (or more), comprising updates of latitudinal and bathymetric ranges. Stony corals were recorded as basibionts of a variety of organisms. Mainly dead skeletons were found providing a suitable settlement substrate for sessile species such as primnoid corals. The presence of a high richness of stony corals on the southern slope of Burdwood Bank, as components of the marine animal forests recorded, also supported the conservation efforts made to create the new MPA named ``Namuncur\'a/Burdwood Bank II'' in this region.},

We used quali- and quantitative data obtained from research cruises developed by Argentina in 2016 and 2017. The results showed that Porifera was the most important component (in terms of wet biomass) of these benthic communities, followed by Cnidaria and Echinodermata. The evidences regarding general composition of the main taxonomical groups of the benthic invertebrate community did not support the maintenance of the original zoning of the MPA (core, buffer, and transition), considering that only a weak differentiation was found among the sub-areas designed in the creation Law. Additionally, the analyzed evidences also demonstrated that this MPA was different from other neighboring areas. Vulnerable and fragile organisms recorded in many locations led to the detection of fourteen sites located inside the MPA Namuncur\'a that meet the characteristics of VMEs (wet biomass of\,{$\geq$}\,10~kg 1200~m-2 of vulnerable and fragile species). These evidences reinforce the conservation value of these particular and susceptible sub-Antarctic benthic communities, composed of both Antarctic and Magellanic species.},

  abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long\textemdash term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11\textemdash yr period and for the nine non\textemdash drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non\textemdash drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity\textemdash stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long\textemdash standing dispute.},

Based on stomach content analyses of 441 specimens ranging from 38 to 190~cm total length (TL), our study tested the hypotheses that diet was influenced by TL, sex, maturity stage, depth, and region, using generalized linear models and information theory selection criteria. The Patagonian toothfish fed primarily on fish (morid cod Notophycis marginata, myctophids, rattails Macrourus holotrachys and Coelorinchus fasciatus, notothenids Patagonotothen ramsayi, and hoki Macruronus magellanicus), followed by cephalopods (Onykia ingens, Doryteuthis gahi) and shrimps (Acanthephyra pelagica). One case of cannibalism was recorded. The trophic level was 4.57 (4.22 juveniles, 4.78 adults). The pelagic fish and bathypelagic shrimp were more consumed in the east region, whereas demersal fish and cephalopods were more consumed in the west one. Ontogenetic dietary changes associated with TL and maturity stage were reported: pelagic fish and shrimp A. pelagica had the main importance in the diet of intermediate-sized toothfish, reinforcing the hypothesis that juveniles exhibited a bento-pelagic behavior. Demersal fish were more heavily consumed by juvenile specimens, and the size of demersal fish predated by Patagonian toothfish increased according to the predator TL. Cephalopods were more consumed by adults. The preference of sexually mature specimens for cephalopods could have a positive effect on spawning and egg quality.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
