  abstract = {Neritic fronts are very abundant in austral South America, covering several scales of space and time. However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile\textendash Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.},

  abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network1. Complex communication networks2 display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web3,4,5, the Internet6, social networks7 and cells8. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

Gelatinous plankton occurred in diets of seven species with two species, Patagonotothen ramsayi and Squalus acanthias, having {$>$}10\% ctenophores in their diet. Consumption of gelatinous plankton was important in P. ramsayi and was strikingly seasonal, with maximum occurrence (up to 46\% of non-empty stomachs) in late summer to autumn. Ctenophores were most abundant in P. ramsayi of 25\textendash 34 cm total length, LT, whereas salps were more frequent in larger {$>$}35 cm LT individuals. In winter to spring, occurrence of gelatinous plankton in diets was minimal, reflecting their overall seasonal abundance in the ocean. The recent increase in abundance of P. ramsayi has enabled the species to recycle a significant proportion of the ecosystem production from gelatinous dead end to the main muscular food chain via seasonal reliance on ctenophores, jellyfish and tunicates. This additional influx of production that has been diverted from the gelatinous food chain favours the increase in abundance of several piscivorous top predators and affects the trophic web structure of the Patagonian Shelf ecosystem.},

A hypothesis is that `small-world' food webs are sensitive to the loss of species with the highest values. Therefore, the present work aimed to evaluate the degree to which a subtropical food web in Southern Brazil displays small-world patterns and their resistance. As part of the assessment, we evaluated the topological redundancy values of species in the food web and then we simulated the exclusion of these species (such as sharks and sea birds), and also the exclusion of high centrality species (such as squids Loligo sp., portunid swimming crabs and the cutlassfish Trichiurus lepturus). The food web showed a `broad-scale' distribution of connections by node, and a small-world pattern. As expected, a simplification of the network was observed after elimination of some species with high centrality. However, the food web was resistant to the loss of species with low topological redundancy, probably because these species occupy a high trophic level and do not participate in lots of routes within the food web. We highlight however, the importance of the application of multiple analyses to evaluate the importance of components in food webs, and fisheries management plans should consider both species of high centrality values and species with low topological redundancy.},

We offer an explanation based on the stability of food chains that have been shifted away from linearity to be more web-like. We start with a simple example of food webs of two to six species arranged so that species consume all those with a trophic level less than their own. The probability of stability, for such ``universal omnivory'' chains declined strongly with chain length, and was as low as 1\% with six level chains but highest for two and three level chains. We further explored the influence of chain length on food web stability by testing food webs with varying levels of connectance that were constructed either randomly or with the niche model. By additionally altering the relative impacts of predators on prey, and vice-versa, we test the role of our assumptions on the relationship between chain length and stability. Food webs characterized by low to moderate degrees of connectance, asymmetrical interactions, and relatively weak density dependence showed a pattern of reduced stability with longer trophic chains. The simple view that food webs characterized by long trophic chains are less stable seems to resolve the long-standing question of why there are so few trophic levels in nature.},

For a given number of species per functional group, the risk of further extinctions is highest when an autotroph is removed and lowest when a top predator is removed. In addition, stability decreases when the distribution of interaction strengths in the webs is changed from equal to skew (few strong and many weak links).

A total of 49 different prey items were found in the stomach contents of the two species, with the hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii and Euphausiacea being amongst the most important prey. Although the species composition did not change over fish size, the proportions of individual prey items in their diets did, with an increase in T. gaudichaudii and Euphausiacea with increasing fish size in southern blue whiting. The opposite occurred in hoki. Seasonal variations in the diet were found to mirror the seasonal abundance of prey around the Falkland Islands for the two species. Intra-specific differences in the diet of both predators reflected the distribution of prey, which in turn was determined by the water structure in the two regions sampled, leading to very different diets. In the limited time that the two species occupied the same space there was little or no competition resulting in almost total segregation of their trophic niches in space and time.},

  abstract = {Predator\textendash prey interactions in natural ecosystems generate complex food webs that have a simple universal body-size architecture where predators are systematically larger than their prey. Food-web theory shows that the highest predator\textendash prey body-mass ratios found in natural food webs may be especially important because they create weak interactions with slow dynamics that stabilize communities against perturbations and maintain ecosystem functioning. Identifying these vital interactions in real communities typically requires arduous identification of interactions in complex food webs. Here, we overcome this obstacle by developing predator-trait models to predict average body-mass ratios based on a database comprising 290 food webs from freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems across all continents. We analysed how species traits constrain body-size architecture by changing the slope of the predator\textendash prey body-mass scaling. Across ecosystems, we found high body-mass ratios for predator groups with specific trait combinations including (1) small vertebrates and (2) large swimming or flying predators. Including the metabolic and movement types of predators increased the accuracy of predicting which species are engaged in high body-mass ratio interactions. We demonstrate that species traits explain striking patterns in the body-size architecture of natural food webs that underpin the stability and functioning of ecosystems, paving the way for community-level management of the most complex natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many different concepts have been used to describe species' roles in food webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of ``gray areas'' between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

  abstract = {Antarctica is seriously affected by climate change, particularly at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) where a rapid regional warming is observed. Potter Cove is a WAP fjord at Shetland Islands that constitutes a biodiversity hotspot where over the last years, Potter Cove annual air temperatures averages increased by 0.66 \textdegree C, coastal glaciers declined, and suspended particulate matter increased due to ice melting. Macroalgae are the main energy source for all consumers and detritivores of Potter Cove. Some effects of climate change favor pioneer macroalgae species that exploit new ice-free areas and can also decline rates of photosynthesis and intensify competition between species due to the increase of suspended particulate matter. In this study, we evaluated possible consequences of climate change at Potter Cove food web by simulating the extinction of macroalgae and detritus using a topological approach with thresholds of extinction. Thresholds represent the minimum number of incoming links necessary for species' survival. When we simulated the extinctions of macroalgae species at random, a threshold of extinction beyond 50\% was necessary to obtain a significant number of secondary extinctions, while with a 75\% threshold a real collapse of the food web occurred. Our results indicate that Potter Cove food web is relative robust to macroalgae extinction. This is dramatically different from what has been found in other food webs, where the reduction of 10\% in prey intake caused a disproportionate increase of secondary extinctions. Robustness of the Potter Cove food web was mediated by omnivory and redundancy, which had an important relevance in this food web. When we eliminated larger-biomass species more secondary extinctions occurred, a similar response was observed when more connected species were deleted, yet there was no correlation between species of larger-biomass and high-degree. This similarity could be explained because both criteria involved key species that produced an emerging effect on the food web. In this way, large-biomass and high-degree species could be acting as source for species with few trophic interactions or low redundancy. Based on this work, we expect the Potter Cove food web to be robust to changes in macroalgae species caused by climate change until a high threshold of stress is reached, and then negative effects are expected to spread through the entire food web leading to its collapse.},

This study evaluated for the first time the occurrence of microplastics in benthic organisms from the Marine Protected Area Namuncur\'a at Burdwood Bank, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Microplastics were isolated from the soft tissue of the sea stars Henricia obesa and Odontaster penicillatus using an oxidative treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The chemical composition of the particles was identified with Raman spectroscopy. Fibers and fragments were found in similar proportions in both species. Fibers were identified as semi-synthetic cellulose, while the polymeric composition of fragments was masked by the synthetic pigment Phthalo blue. Over half of the sea stars contained microplastics (61\%). In H. obesa, the mean abundance was 1.00\,{$\pm$}\,1.03 particles per individual and 3.34\,{$\pm$}\,4.13 particles per gram, and in O. penicillatus, the mean abundance was 2.70\,{$\pm$}\,2.91 particles per individual and 1.94\,{$\pm$}\,2.09 particles per gram. Fibers were predominantly blue, and all fragments were bluish/turquoise. Microplastic sizes ranged from 24 to 1340~\textmu m, and most particles (approximately 90\%) were less than 1~mm. These results provide a baseline assessment of the abundance and type of microplastics in benthic organisms from this sub-Antarctic protected area and contribute to the scant data on microplastic pollution in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

Thus, diet composition and feeding habits were analyzed. To fulfill this purpose, percentage frequency of occurrence, prey-specific abundance, and prey-specific index of relative importance (\%PSIRI) were calculated. Generalized linear models were built for the defined prey categories to assess changes in feeding associated with total length, sex, depth, and zone of capture. Two hundred fifty-two specimens were sampled (69\textendash 256~mm total length), of which 186 contained food (73.41\%). According to PSIRI, ophiuroids (23.28\%), unidentified polychaetes (17.92\%), and Munida~gregaria (12.73\%) were the main prey items. However, yellowfin notothen showed variations in diet composition according to their length and the depth of capture. The consumption of decapods and other invertebrates increased with depth, while the ingestion of ophiuroids decreased. Also, the number of polychaetes was higher in the stomach content of larger specimens. The present work provides the first description and analysis of P.~guntheri trophic ecology in the MPAN-BB, concluding that it is a species with a generalist diet, which feeds on a great diversity of both benthic and pelagic organisms depending on availability.},

  abstract = {In upwelling ecosystems, there is often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level ``wasp-waist'' populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a ``school trap'' that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems.},

This region exhibits a classical pelagic\textendash benthic dichotomy of food-web structure in ecological function. The Klondike study area borders the eastern edge of the Central Channel and functions as a pelagic-dominated ecosystem, whereas the Burger study area lies south of Hanna Shoal and functions as a benthic-dominated ecosystem. The Statoil study area, which is located north of Klondike and northwest of Burger, has both pelagic and benthic attributes, although it is more like Burger than like Klondike. Klondike has lower benthic density and biomass, a higher biomass of oceanic zooplankton, and more fishes and planktivorous seabirds than does Burger, which has benthic communities with high density and biomass, primarily neritic zooplankton, and higher densities of benthic-feeding marine mammals than Klondike; Statoil has characteristics of both ecosystems. Patterns of sea-ice retreat vary interannually; in some years, much of the northeastern Chukchi is ice-free by mid-May, leading to pelagic and ice-edge phytoplankton blooms, whereas heavy ice cover in other years leads to substantial within-ice production. The characteristics of this region during the open-water season are not consistent among years, in that Bering Sea Water impinges onto all study areas only in some years, resulting in interannual variation in the distribution and abundance of zooplankton, planktivorous seabirds, and pelagic-feeding seals. These interannual variations alter several aspects of this pelagic\textendash benthic dichotomy, and some aspects of this region suggest unusual structure (e.g., replacement of benthic-feeding fishes in some areas by predatory invertebrates, a lack of benthic-feeding seaducks).},

The main contribution of this work was to explore fish species composition and the structure of fish assemblages in three different zones of the MPAN-BB with different conservation strategies and different surrounding areas. Twenty-two fishing trawls were performed using a demersal bottom trawl pilot net at depths between 71 and 608~m. A total of 667 fish belonging to 30 species were collected in the surveyed area. The richest family in terms of species number was Nototheniidae (seven species), followed by Macrouridae, Myxinidae and Zoarcidae (four species each), then Moridae and Arhynchobatidae (three species each), and finally Muraenolepididae and Psychrolutidae (two species each). The remaining families were represented by a single species. Three significantly different fish assemblages were detected. These distinct assemblages were largely circumscribed at the plateau, the shelf-break slope, and the area west of the BB. The results showed that fish diversity in the MPAN-BB is relatively high constituting\,\textasciitilde\,10\% of the fish composition reported for the Atlantic sector of the Magellanic Province. The present data suggest that fishes are an important component of the benthic community planned to be protected by the implementation of the MPAN-BB.

Within these particles, the most abundant and prevalent type in the oceans are anthropogenic microfibers (MFs), although they have been historically overlooked mostly due to methodological constraints. MFs are currently considered omnipresent in natural environments, however, contrary to the Northern Hemisphere, data on their abundance and distribution in Southern Oceans ecosystems are still scarce, in particular for sub-Antarctic regions. Using Niskin bottles we've explored microfibers abundance and distribution in the water column (3\textendash 2450~m depth) at the Burdwood Bank (BB), a seamount located at the southern extreme of the Patagonian shelf, in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The MFs detected from filtered water samples were photographed and measured using ImageJ software, to estimate length, width, and the projected surface area of each particle. Our results indicate that small pieces of fibers are widespread in the water column at the BB (mean of 17.4~{$\pm~$}12.6~MFs.L-1), from which, 10.6~{$\pm~$}5.3~MFs.L-1 were at the surface (3\textendash 10~m depth), 20~{$\pm~$}9~MFs.L-1 in intermediate waters (41\textendash 97~m), 24.6~{$\pm~$}17.3~MFs.L-1 in deeper waters (102\textendash 164~m), and 9.2~{$\pm~$}5.3~MFs.L-1 within the slope break of the seamount. Approximately 76.1\% of the MFs were composed of Polyethylene terephthalate, and the abundance was dominated by the size fraction from 0.1 to 0.3~mm of length. Given the high relative abundance of small and aged MFs, and the oceanographic complexity of the study area, we postulate that MFs are most likely transported to the BB via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our findings imply that this sub-Antarctic protected ecosystem is highly exposed to microplastic pollution, and this threat could be spreading towards the highly productive waters, north of the study area.},

The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modularity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in experimental setups.}

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

  abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as ``small-world'' and ``scale-free.'' However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25\textendash 172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power\textendash law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

  abstract = {1 The loss of a species from an ecological community can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. Here we investigate how the complexity (connectance) of model communities affects their response to species loss. Using dynamic analysis based on a global criterion of persistence (permanence) and topological analysis we investigate the extent of secondary extinctions following the loss of different kinds of species. 2 We show that complex communities are, on average, more resistant to species loss than simple communities: the number of secondary extinctions decreases with increasing connectance. However, complex communities are more vulnerable to loss of top predators than simple communities. 3 The loss of highly connected species (species with many links to other species) and species at low trophic levels triggers, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions. The effect of the connectivity of a species is strongest in webs with low connectance. 4 Most secondary extinctions are due to direct bottom-up effects: consumers go extinct when their resources are lost. Secondary extinctions due to trophic cascades and disruption of predator-mediated coexistence also occur. Secondary extinctions due to disruption of predator-mediated coexistence are more common in complex communities than in simple communities, while bottom-up and top-down extinction cascades are more common in simple communities. 5 Topological analysis of the response of communities to species loss always predicts a lower number of secondary extinctions than dynamic analysis, especially in food webs with high connectance.},

The last concept refers to the absence of structural bottlenecks in the food web, whose removal separate the network into large isolate clusters. In theory networks with identical connectance can display different expansibility characteristics. Using the spectral scaling method we studied 17 food networks and classified them as good expansion (GE) and not-GE networks. The combination of GE properties and degree distribution of species permitted the classification of food webs into six different classes. These classes characterize the differences in robustness of food webs to species loss. While the webs having uniform degree distributions and displaying GE properties are the most robust to species loss, the presence of bottlenecks and skewed distribution of the number of links per species make food webs very vulnerable to primary removal of species.},

According to classical results from mathematical food web theory, omnivory destabilizes ecological communities, whereas more recent conceptual syntheses suggest that omnivory should be a strongly stabilizing factor in food webs. Working with an arthropod assemblage at Mount Saint Helens, I experimentally addressed this controversy using a two-way factorial design that crossed a manipulation of the degree of omnivory with another ``disturbance'' manipulation that targeted a specific component of the assemblage. In this statistical design, significant interaction effects (i.e., how the community impacts of the disturbance varied with the degree of omnivory) identified key stabilizing or destabilizing influences of omnivory. Overall, my experimental results indicated that increasing the degree of omnivory stabilized community dynamics, in keeping with recent conceptual syntheses.}

This study makes progress in this direction, describing the most recent advances in marine conservation in Chile and analysing the contribution of the different conservation instruments as well as the distribution of designated areas across ecoregions. Furthermore, it examines the potential contribution of alternative area-based instruments to balance ocean protection. The advances observed in Chile were compared among four South American countries and five leading countries in ocean conservation, analysing protection levels in coastal areas, continental exclusive economic zones, and overseas territories. Data on MPA boundaries and attributes were sourced from the World Database on Protected Areas and complemented the official information on MPAs and territorial user rights for fisheries and for indigenous people in South America. The current level of protection in Chile is among the highest in the world in area coverage and in the proportion of the continental exclusive economic zone assigned to fully protected areas. However, it exhibits the strongest imbalances in the distribution of designated MPAs between coastal and oceanic waters, in comparison with the leading countries and also within South America (Per\'u, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay), and among ecoregions. The patterns observed suggest that Chile has advanced, but concentrated, conservation efforts in low-threat, remote ecoregions. There is an urgent need to progress towards high-threat ecoregions, which implies balancing the needs of nature and people. The distribution of ancillary conservation instruments can help double the level of protection in threatened coastal areas, filling gaps in marine conservation and creating an opportunity to progress and diversify conservation strategies.},

The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the feeding ecology of longtail southern cod in the Marine Protected Area Namuncur\'a-Burdwood Bank (MPAN-BB). From 369 specimens sampled, 229 (62.06\%) contained food. Prey-specific index of relative importance (\%PSIRI) for each prey was calculated showing that P. ramsayi preyed mainly on polychaetes (21.07\%), amphipods (14.89\%), other crustaceans (13.25\%), and decapods (11.62\%). The analysis of the feeding strategy confirms that P. ramsayi is a generalist feeder. The effect of sex, ontogenetic stage, total length (TL), and capture depth was evaluated using generalized linear models. All prey categories were independent of sex, while a differential consumption of isopods and polychaetes according to the ontogenetic stage was observed. Isopods were more consumed by juveniles, while polychaetes were fed by adults. The intake of amphipods and decapods was not influenced by any of the studied variables. Regarding capture depth, the consumption of euphausiids and polychaetes was higher in shallower areas, in contrast to teleost and isopods that were more ingested at greater depths. Finally, the intake of euphausiids, teleosts, and polychaetes was positively influenced by the total length of the predator, while the consumption of other invertebrates was negatively related. It may be concluded that Patagonotothen ramsayi in the MPAN-BB has a generalist diet and demersal-benthic feeding habits, changing its diet with total length and depth of capture.},

The observed patterns of atmospheric circulation anomalies are consistent with anthropogenic climate change. There is strong scientific evidence suggesting that the Brazil Current is intensifying and shifting southwards during the past decades in response to changes in near-surface wind patterns, leading to intense ocean warming along the path of the Brazil Current, the South Brazil Bight, and in the R\'io de la Plata. These changes are presumably responsible for the poleward shift of commercially important pelagic species in the region and the long-term shift from cold-water to warm-water species in industrial fisheries of Uruguay. Scientific and traditional knowledge shows that climate change is also affecting small-scale fisheries. Long-term records suggest that mass mortalities decimated harvested clam populations along coastal ecosystems of the region, leading to prolonged shellfishery closures. More frequent and intense harmful algal blooms together with unfavorable environmental conditions driven by climate change stressors affect coastal shellfisheries, impact economic revenues, and damage the livelihood of local communities. We identify future modelling needs to reduce uncertainty in the expected effects of climate change on marine fisheries. However, the paucity of fisheries data prevents a more effective assessment of the impact of climate change on fisheries and hampers the ability of governments and communities to adapt to these changes.},

In the long term, some species are more vulnerable to fishery impacts than others, which can lead to permanent changes on the food web. The trophic relationships between predator and prey constitute the food web and it represents a network of the energy channels in an ecosystem. In turn, the network structure influences ecosystem diversity and stability. The first aim of this study was to describe for the first time the food web of the San Jorge Gulf (Patagonia Argentina) with high resolution, i.e.~to the species level when information is available. The San Jorge Gulf was subject to intense fisheries thus our second aim is to analyse the food web structure with and without fishery to evaluate if the bottom-trawl industrial fishery altered the network structure and stability. We used several network metrics like: mean trophic level, omnivory, modularity and quasi-sign stability. We included these metrics because they are related to stability and can be evaluated using predator diets that can weight the links between predators and prey. The network presented 165 species organized in almost five trophic levels. The inclusion of a fishery node adds 69 new trophic links. All weighted and unweighted metrics showed differences between the two networks, reflecting a decrease in stability when fishery was included in the system. Thus, our results suggested a probable change of state of the system. The observed changes in species abundances since the fishery was established, could represent the state change predicted by network analysis. Our results suggests that changes in the stability of food webs can be used to evaluate the impacts of human activity on ecosystems.},

Understanding the dynamics of species inhabiting the NMPA\textendash BB is relevant to establish future adequate management strategies. We assessed the abundance, size, and development of S. fuegensis early life stages during spring, summer, and autumn in order to evaluate their seasonal patterns. Compared to neighboring areas, S. fuegensis was particularly abundant in the NMPA\textendash BB, which can be considered a major spawning and nursery ground. Within the NMPA\textendash BB, abundances tend to be higher at the center, probably as a result of the marine currents. Eggs were only recorded in spring, while larvae were recorded in all seasons sampled, with maximum abundances occurring during spring. Larger larval sizes and more developed stages occurred in summer and autumn. Analysis of otolith microstructure showed that spawning periods take place between October and March, peaking in November. Slow growth rates (maximum of 0.30~mm~day-1) and prolonged larval phase would respond to the low temperatures recorded in the NMPA\textendash BB. Additionally, marked monthly differences in otolith growth would suggest a seasonal effect on the developmental patterns of S. fuegensis larvae. Future studies will be necessary to completely understand S. fuegensis development and determine its trophic role in the NMPA\textendash BB.},

Heterogeneities in the resolution of food webs used in the literature have led to question their use to establish general topological rules. Despite an increasing number of studies relating topology to ecosystem functioning, we still have no idea on how species' aggregation affects our perception of network functionalities. Therefore, we re-examined the conclusions drawn from an experimental manipulation relating top-predator foraging behaviour and biomass to food-web topology (Lazzaro et al. 2009) by aggregating a 74-species network according to different criteria (taxonomy, trophic similarity, size, expertise). We found that initial significant effects and functional properties were preserved over a large portion of the aggregation gradient (2/3) despite strong variations in the topological descriptor values along the gradient. Aggregation tended to produce more type II errors (false positive) than type I errors, advocating that most effects in aggregated networks are not methodological artefacts. Aggregation by taxonomy, trophic similarity and expertise better preserved functional properties (down to 38, 30 and 17 nodes, respectively) than aggregation by size (down to 40 nodes). Our results suggest that it is possible to relate the structure of aggregated networks to ecosystem properties provided that the methodological approaches are standardized and the level of lumping does not a exceed a reasonable threshold.},

This region is characterized by high biological productivity, and by an exceptional tidal regime that interacts with the subpolar Falkland/Malvinas (FM) current. The results presented contribute to the development of an ecohydrodynamic system intended for the study of the implications of increasing exploitation of natural resources in the region. Detailed tidal charts show the propagation on the continental shelf of tidal waves related to clockwise amphidromes in the South Atlantic, indicating the occurrence of resonance. The averaged velocity field is dominated by the FM current, although tidal residuals around headlands are significant on the Patagonian coast. In contrast, ``snapshots'' describe the interaction between the tides and the FM current, where the flow patterns displayed are expected to influence the population dynamics of biological species. The mean wind stress induces strong currents and a large anticlockwise circulation cell northeast of Tierra del Fuego. The strong tidal and FM currents generate shelf sea fronts whose locations, revealed by contours of the Simpson-Hunter parameter, are related to major fishing grounds. Because of the lack of velocity measurements in the region, the FM and wind-driven currents simulated by the model should be taken as experimental results until proper comparisons with observations can be made.},

In ecology, it has been posited that a modular organization of species interactions would benefit the dynamical stability of communities, even though evidence supporting this hypothesis is mixed. Here we study the effect of modularity on the local stability of ecological dynamical systems, by presenting new results in random matrix theory, which are obtained using a quaternionic parameterization of the cavity method. Results show that modularity can have moderate stabilizing effects for particular parameter choices, while anti-modularity can greatly destabilize ecological networks.},

In particular, the 1994 horizontal distribution of temperature, salinity and density was mapped in order to show the extreme winter pattern of these parameters.

Horizontal and vertical distribution of chlorophyll a from the 1995 cruise is presented as reference data, considering the lack of information on this parameter for the area. Finally, the inter-annual variability of the heat content in two 5\textdegree{} x 5\textdegree{} areas (East and West to the islands) is discussed by comparing the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data between the four sampled years.

Metabolic networks6,7,8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

The Burdwood Bank (BB) is a submerged plateau (average depth 100 m) that constitutes the westernmost segment of the North Scotia Ridge (54\textdegree\textendash 55\textdegree S; 56\textdegree\textendash 62\textdegree W). The BB hosts rich benthic biodiversity in low chlorophyll waters of the southern Patagonian Shelf, Argentina, declared Namuncur\'a Marine Protected Area (NMPA) in 2013. So far, the pelagic microorganisms above the bank have not been described. During austral summer 2016, we assessed the microbial plankton (0.2\textendash 200 {$\mu$}m cell size) biomass and their taxonomical and functional diversity along a longitudinal transect (54.2\textendash 55.3\textdegree S, 58\textendash 68\textdegree W) from the Beagle Channel (BC) to the BB, characterized by contrasting hydrography. Results displayed a marked zonation in the composition and structure of the microbial communities. The biomass of phytoplankton {$>$}5 {$\mu$}m was 28 times higher in the BC, attributed mainly to large diatom blooms, than in oceanic waters above the BB, where the small coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and flagellates {$<$}10 {$\mu$}m dominated. In turn, the biomass of microheterotrophs above the BB doubled the biomass in the BC due to large ciliates. Notably, toxic phytoplankton species and their phycotoxins were detected, in particular high abundance of Dinophysis acuminata and pectenotoxins above the bank, highlighting their presence in open subpolar regions. Picophytoplankton ({$<$}2 {$\mu$}m), including Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, were remarkably important above the BB, both at surface and deep waters (up to 150 m). Their biomass surpassed by 5 times that of phytoplankton {$>$} 5 {$\mu$}m, emphasizing the importance of small-sized phytoplankton in low chlorophyll waters. The homogeneous water column and high retention above the bank seem to favor the development of abundant picophytoplankton and microzooplankton communities. Overall, our findings unfold the plankton configuration in the Southern Patagonian Shelf, ascribed as a sink for anthropogenic CO2, and highlight the diverse ecological traits that microorganisms develop to adjust their yield to changing conditions.},

  abstract = {The robustness of networks against node failure and the response of networks to node removal has been studied extensively for networks such as transportation networks, power grids, and food webs. In many cases, a network's clustering coefficient was identified as a good indicator for network robustness. In ecology, habitat networks constitute a powerful tool to represent metapopulations or -communities, where nodes represent habitat patches and links indicate how these are connected. Current climate and land-use changes result in decline of habitat area and its connectivity and are thus the main drivers for the ongoing biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts are therefore needed to improve the connectivity and mitigate effects of habitat loss. Habitat loss can easily be modelled with the help of habitat networks and the question arises how to modify networks to obtain higher robustness. Here, we develop tools to identify which links should be added to a network to increase the robustness. We introduce two different heuristics, Greedy and Lazy Greedy, to maximize the clustering coefficient if multiple links can be added. We test these approaches and compare the results to the optimal solution for different generic networks including a variety of standard networks as well as spatially explicit landscape based habitat networks. In a last step, we simulate the robustness of habitat networks before and after adding multiple links and investigate the increase in robustness depending on both the number of added links and the heuristic used. We found that using our heuristics to add links to sparse networks such as habitat networks has a greater impact on the clustering coefficient compared to randomly adding links. The Greedy algorithm delivered optimal results in almost all cases when adding two links to the network. Furthermore, the robustness of networks increased with the number of additional links added using the Greedy or Lazy Greedy algorithm.},

Here we present an interdisciplinary approach to marine landscape mapping at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia as an effective protocol for underpinning large-scale (105\textendash 106 \,km2) MPA designations. We have developed a new high-resolution (100\,m) digital elevation model (DEM) of the region and integrated this DEM with bathymetry-derived parameters, modelled oceanographic data, and satellite primary productivity data. These interdisciplinary datasets were used to apply an objective statistical approach to hierarchically partition and map the benthic environment into physical habitats types. We assess the potential application of physical habitat classifications as proxies for biological structuring and the application of the landscape mapping for informing on marine spatial planning.},

However, the connection between weak interactions, derived from the theory of modular food web components, and keystone species, derived from empirical results, is not yet well understood. Here, we develop numerical techniques to detect potential oscillators hidden in complex food webs, and show that, both in random and real food webs, keystone consumer\textendash resource interactions often operate to stabilise them. Alarmingly, this result suggests that nature frequently may be dangerously close to precipitous change with even the loss of one or a few weakly interacting species.},

In contrast to the hypothesis that nested structure enhances biodiversity in mutualistic communities, we also suggest that nested food webs increase niche overlap among consumers and thus prevent their coexistence.

Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by poleward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food-web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food-web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food-web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food-web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food-web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food-web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food-web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However, the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food-web structure, implying that interacting species may co-vary in space. In conclusion, our study shows how environmental heterogeneity, via environmental filtering, influences not only turnover in species composition, but also the structure of food webs over large spatial scales.},

Yet, temporal studies of highly resolved food web structure are scarce. With few exceptions, most temporal food web studies are either too simplified, preventing a detailed assessment of structural properties or binary, missing the temporal dynamics of energy fluxes among species. Using long-term, multi-trophic biomass data coupled with highly resolved information on species feeding relationships, we analysed food web dynamics in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) over more than three decades (1981\textendash 2014). We combined unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (biomass- and flux-based) food web approaches, first, to unravel how distinct descriptors can highlight differences (or similarities) in food web dynamics through time, and second, to compare temporal dynamics of food web structure and function. We find that food web descriptors vary substantially and distinctively through time, likely reflecting different underlying ecosystem processes. While node- and link-weighted metrics reflect changes related to alterations in species dominance and fluxes, unweighted metrics are more sensitive to changes in species and link richness. Comparing unweighted, topology-based metrics and flux-based functions further indicates that temporal changes in functions cannot be predicted using unweighted food web structure. Rather, information on species population dynamics and weighted, flux-based networks should be included to better comprehend temporal food web dynamics. By integrating unweighted, node- and link-weighted metrics, we here demonstrate how different approaches can be used to compare food web structure and function, and identify complementary patterns of change in temporal food web dynamics, which enables a more complete understanding of the ecological processes at play in ecosystems undergoing change.},

Since species are components of food webs, one way to conceptualize and quantify species importance is from a network perspective. The importance of a species can be quantified by measuring the centrality of its position in a food web, because a central node may have greater influence on others in the network. A species may also be important because it has a unique network position, such that its loss cannot be easily compensated. Therefore, for a food web to be robust, we hypothesize that central species must be functionally redundant in terms of their network position. In this paper, we test our hypothesis by analysing the Prince William Sound ecosystem. We found that species centrality and uniqueness are negatively correlated, and such an observation is also carried over to other food webs.},

Here we describe Burdwoodipora paguricola gen. et sp. nov., a cheilostome bryozoan associated with pagurized shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus comptus White in subantarctic waters of the Southwest Atlantic. The association seems to be obligate, as the bryozoan was always found enlarging the last whorl of its gastropod substrate. The new species, however, is not species specific with regard to its shell substrate, as it was found to be associated with 31 species of gastropods with helicoidal coiling. Well-developed colonies may project up to 360\textdegree{} from the outer lip of the shell. The chamber built by the bryozoan is usually larger than the whorl that would have been generated by the gastropod. This is one of the few known cases of an obligate association between a bryozoan and a pagurid crab outside the ascophoran family Hippoporidridae and is also the first bryozoan/hermit crab symbiosis documented in the subantarctic region.

  abstract = {Knowledge of the food web structure and complexity are central to better understand ecosystem functioning. A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species' ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.},

  abstract = {The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39\% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A detailed and relatively evenly resolved food web of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, was constructed to evaluate the sensitivity of food\textemdash web patterns to the level of detail (degree of resolution) in food\textemdash web data. This study presents definitions (e.g., ecosystem food webs) and methods for constructing and reducing the resolution of food webs to provide relatively pragmatic and rigorous touchstones for consistency in future food\textemdash web studies. This analysis suggests that food\textemdash web patterns such as the scale\textemdash invariant links\textemdash per\textemdash species ratio, short chain lengths, and limited number of trophic levels are constrained by the resolution of food\textemdash web data rather than by ecological factors. Patterns less sensitive to changes in resolution such as directed connectance (the proportion of observed directed links to all possible directed links) may be robust food\textemdash web attributes. The food web of Little Rock Lake appears to be the first highly and evenly resolved food web of a large natural ecosystem originally documented for the purpose of examining quantitative food\textemdash web patterns. This ecosystem food web contains roughly twice as many species as the largest web to date. It also may provide the most credible portrait available of the detailed trophic structure of a whole ecosystem. The 93\textemdash trophic\textemdash species web of Little Rock Lake differs from previously published trophic\textemdash species webs by having more links per species (L/S = 11), longer chain lengths (average: {$\geq$}10, maximum: {$\geq$}16), species at higher trophic levels (maximum: = 12), higher fractions of intermediate species, and smaller fractions of top species and links to top species. The sensitivity of quantitative food\textemdash web patterns to changes in resolution was examined in several series of tropically aggregated Little Rock Lake webs. Each of the series starts with a highly and relatively evenly resolved web with 182 consumer, producer, and decomposer taxa and ends with low\textemdash resolution webs with 9 aggregates of taxa. Taxa were aggregated based on the proportion of predators and prey shared by the taxa. Different series of webs were generated using different criteria for linking aggregates to evaluate the sensitivity of food\textemdash web patterns to linkage criteria. The sensitivity analysis revealed that several, but not all, quantitative food\textemdash web patterns are very sensitive to systematic aggregation of the web. Sensitive patterns include number of links per species, linkage complexity, the distributions of chain lengths and species among trophic levels, and the proportions of top species and links to top species. Less\textemdash sensitive patterns include connectance, the ratio of predators to prey, the proportions of intermediate and basal species, and the proportions of links that are between intermediate and basal species. Directed connectance is the only pattern examined that is both very robust to trophic aggregation and generally comparable to other community webs. Quantitative food\textemdash web patterns in published community webs are generally similar to highly aggregated Little Rock Lake webs (versions with 9\textemdash 40 aggregates). These findings suggest that previously described community food webs are severely aggregated versions of more elaborate webs similar to that of Little Rock Lake.},

This hypothesis is corroborated by the following analysis of 175 community food webs (2-93 trophic species), which shows that the exponent of the link-species relationship is approximately two. This scaling contradicts the widely accepted link-species scaling law, which asserts that links increase linearly with the number of species and that the link-species exponent is one. My results combined with related findings regarding food chain lengths indicate that large food webs have many more links and much longer food chains than previously suggested.}

Mean chain length, the ratio of links per species, and the fractions of intermediate species and links between intermediate species decrease as the trophic-species webs are aggregated to half their size. Concurrently, the fractions of top species, basal species, and links between top and basal species increase. Directed connectance and the predator/prey ratio appear to be relatively robust to reducing the trophic resolution of food web data. Significant effects of reducing the taxonomic resolution of food webs are also demonstrated. These findings are inconsistent with prominent claims that most properties are robust to varying the resolution of food web data. Problems responsible for this inconsistency are identified.}

Model analysis shows energetic upwelling and mixing uplifting deep and benthic waters into the photic layer. Tides and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are the primary drivers of the bank's circulation. Tidal forcing is the main driver for the entrainment of deep waters into the upper layers of the bank and local wind forcing for the detrainment of these waters into the deep ocean. Passive tracer diagnostics suggest that the dynamical processes triggered by the Burdwood Bank could have a significant impact on local ecosystems and the biogeochemical balance of the southwestern Atlantic region, which is one of the most fertile portions of the Southern Ocean. Model results are robust\textemdash they are reproduced in a wide array of model configurations\textemdash but there is insufficient observational evidence to corroborate them. Satellite color imagery does not show substantial chlorophyll blooms in this region but it shows strong phytoplankton plumes emanating from the bank. There are several potential explanations for the chlorophyll deficit, including lack of light due to persistent cloud cover, deep mixing layers, fast ocean currents, and the likelihood that blooms, while extant, might not develop on the surface. None of these possibilities can be confirmed at this stage.},

In this paper, we re\textendash investigate the role of omnivory in food webs using a non\textendash equilibrium perspective. We find that the addition of omnivory to a simple food chain model (thus a simple food web) locally stabilizes the food web in a very complete way.

Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

Non-trivial differences are shown in link distribution frequencies between species-rich and species-poor communities, which might have important consequences for the responses of ecosystems to disturbances. Coarse-grained topological properties observed, as species richness-connectance and number of links-species richness relationships, provide no support for the theory of links-species scaling law or constant connectance across empirical food webs investigated. We further explore these observations by means of simulated food webs resulting from multitrophic assembly models using different functional responses between species. Species richness-connectance and links-species richness relationships of empirical food webs are reproduced by our models, but degree distributions are not properly predicted, suggesting the need of new theoretical approximations to food web assembly. The best agreement between empirical and simulated webs occurs for low values of interaction strength between species, corroborating previous empirical and theoretical findings where weak interactions govern food web dynamics.},

We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum ``loop weight'' and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities.},

Nonetheless, its definition has been varied and problematic, including a range of recent definitions based on biological rates associated with model parameters (e.g., attack rate). Results from food web theory have been used to argue that IS metrics based on energy flux ought to have a clear relationship with stability. Here, we use simple models to elucidate the actual relationship between local stability and a number of common IS metrics (total flux and per capita fluxes) as well as a more recently suggested metric. We find that the classical IS metrics map to stability in a more complex way than suggested by existing food web theory and that the new IS metric has a much clearer, and biologically interpretable, relationship with local stability. The total energy flux metric falls off existing theoretical predictions when the total resource productivity available to the consumer is reduced despite increased consumer attack rates. The density of a consumer can hence decrease when its attack rate increases. This effect, called the paradox of attack rate, is similar to the well-known hydra effect and can even cascade up a food chain to exclude a predator when consumer attack rate is increased.},

  abstract = {Despite the recognised effectiveness of networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) as a biodiversity conservation instrument, MPA network design frequently disregards the importance of connectivity patterns. In the case of sedentary marine populations, connectivity stems not only from the stochastic nature of the physical environment that affects dispersal of early life stages, but also from the spawning stock attributes that affect reproductive output (e.g. passive eggs and larvae) and survivorship. Early life stages are virtually impossible to track in the ocean. Therefore, numerical ocean current simulations coupled with egg and larval Lagrangian transport models remain the most common approach for the assessment of marine larval connectivity. Inferred larval connectivity may differ depending on the type of connectivity considered; consequently, the prioritisation of sites for the conservation of marine populations might also differ. Here, we introduce a framework for evaluating and designing MPA networks based on the identification of connectivity hotspots using graph theoretic analysis. As a case study, we used a network of open-access areas and MPAs off Mallorca Island (Spain), and tested its effectiveness for the protection of the painted comber               Serranus scriba               . Outputs from network analysis were used to (1) identify critical areas for improving overall larval connectivity, (2) assess the impact of species' biological parameters in network connectivity and (3) explore alternative MPA configurations to improve average network connectivity. Results demonstrate the potential of graph theory to identify non-trivial egg/larval dispersal patterns and emerging collective properties of the MPA network, which are relevant for increasing protection efficiency.},

A total of 461 trawl samples were collected during seven seasonal cruises. A total of 17 out of 38 fish species were found to ingest T. gaudichaudii. This amphipod was a main prey item in five of these species, showing high values of alimentary index: Seriolella porosa (99.9\%), Macruronus magellanicus (68.8\%), Micromesistius australis (59.1\%), Patagonotothen ramsayi (48.6\%), and Merluccius hubbsi (10.9\%). The contribution of T. gaudichaudii, in weight, to their summer diet was 60\%, on average. This contribution was minimal in winter and maximal in summer. Fisheries studies have indicated that these five species, mainly M. magellanicus, account for almost 85\% of the fish biomass in the area. Although the remaining 15\% did not feed heavily on T. gaudichaudii, they are known to prey on the main hyperiid predators. Our study shows that T. gaudichaudii contributes greatly, both directly and indirectly, to supporting the fish community. We thus proposed that T. gaudichaudii plays a key role as a ``wasp-waist'' species in the sub-Antarctic region, similar to that of krill in Antarctic waters, channeling the energy flow and enabling a short and efficient food chain.},

These major contributors to the low salinity intermediate water mass are advected northward along the continental slope of South America. The lower density water type enters the Argentine Basin both east and west of Burdwood Bank. Its thermohaline characteristics are modified by winter sea-air interaction near Burdwood Bank and mixing with the surrounding waters further north. The denser water type flows east of Burdwood Bank, undergoing salinity decrease, primarily by isopycnal processes. Low salinity water, derived from the Polar Front, is introduced into a still denser horizon (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}), from along the axis of the cyclonic circulation feature described by the Malvinas Current and its return to the south. The thermohaline structure across the Malvinas Current is similar to the water mass zonation observed in the northern Drake Passage. In the vicinity of 38\textdegree S, the northward-flowing modified subantarctic water converges with subtropical thermocline water at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. The less dense subantarctic water spreads under the subtropical thermocline; however, the denser water (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}) of Polar Front origin is not found under the subtropical thermocline in the western South Atlantic. In general the salinity at the salinity minimum increases rapidly across the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, suggesting that the bulk of the subantarctic water advected into the region by the Malvinas Current turns towards the interior, spreading under the subtropical thermocline along a broader expanse of the South Atlantic.},

This goal can be achieved in part by acquiring more detailed food web information and evaluating the processes that shape food web structure and dynamics. Our main objective was to identify large-scale patterns in the organization of pelagic food webs that can be linked to a wasp-waist (WW) structure, proposed for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. We evaluated 3 sub-Antarctic marine areas in a regional context: the Beagle Channel (BC), the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego (CA) and the oceanic Burdwood Bank area (BB). We used carbon and nitrogen isotopic information of all functional trophic groups, ranging from primary producers to top predators, and analyzed them through stable isotope-based Bayesian analyses. We found that BC and BB have a more pronounced WW structure compared to CA. We identified species at mid to low trophic positions that play a key role in the trophodynamics of each marine area (e.g. Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, longtail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi and squat lobster Munida gregaria) and considered them as the most plausible WW species. The identification of the most influential species within food webs has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean.},

However, even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent impacts of climate change: acidification, sea-level rise, intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-tech, cost-effective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future.},

Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity and greater stability against perturbations.},

However, currently only 3.6\% of the ocean is in implemented MPAs, and only 2\% is in implemented strongly or fully protected areas. Here we argue that current protection has been overestimated because it includes areas that are not yet protected, and that areas that allow significant extractive activities such as fishing should not count as `protected.' The most rigorous projections suggest that we will not achieve the 10\% target in truly protected areas by 2020. Strongly or fully protected areas are the only ones achieving the goal of protecting biodiversity; hence they should be the MPA of choice to achieve global ocean conservation targets.},

  abstract = {Mean annual temperatures of the Arctic Ocean and Antarctic Peninsula are warming much faster than global mean warming rates, which will likely result in significant biological impacts. Whereas most assessments have been made on individual species, impacts may differ when entire ecosystems are considered, as effects may propagate through ecological interactions such as those in food webs (FWs). The vulnerability of FWs to adverse effects can be estimated from the topology of the networks involved. Here we describe topological characteristics of Arctic and Antarctic marine FWs relevant to their vulnerability to climate change. We analyzed 15 properties of the largest Arctic and Antarctic marine FWs available, and found important topological differences between them. The Arctic FW has greater top to basal and predator to prey species ratios and is more densely connected, with more omnivorous species, than the Antarctic FW. The cumulative degree distribution (CDD; cumulative distribution of the number of links that each species in the food web has) of the Arctic FW follows an exponential decay behavior, whereas that of the Antarctic has a power law cut-off at higher degrees. The differences in the properties analyzed indicate that the Arctic FW has a greater diversity of predators and top species, while the Antarctic has a greater diversity of prey and basal species. The former seems to be more vulnerable to trophic cascade effects resulting from losses of key predator species than the latter. Characteristics of CDDs suggest that the Arctic FW may be more robust against random extinctions of species, although it may be more vulnerable to extinctions affecting the most connected prey species, such as Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which is the most connected prey species in this trophic network.},

Primary productivity and species richness decrease poleward at mid and high latitudes in the Southwestern Atlantic, and hence food chain length of coastal ecosystems is expected to decrease poleward, unless seasonal changes in water temperature destabilise food webs at mid latitude. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R) to determine the food chain length and other patterns of interconnections (i.e. topology) of coastal food webs from 3 contrasting regions: the temperate estuarine zone associated with the R\'io de la Plata plume, the tidal zone off northern and central Patagonia, and the cold estuarine zone off southern Patagonia. Results indicate that food chain length decreases and trophic redundancy increases as latitude increases in all of the compartments of the food web considered. This is in agreement with results emerging from reconstructions of marine food web length during the late Holocene in the same regions, thus suggesting that they are not artefacts caused by the intense exploitation of top predators in the region since European settlement. Furthermore, differences in primary productivity do not fully explain the observed patterns. Instead, we argue that the latitudinal reduction of species diversity reported for the Southwestern Atlantic may be the primary reason for the observed pattern. The reduction in the diversity of forage fishes and squids at high latitude is proposed to result into a wasp-waist ecosystem, characterised by a high trophic redundancy at high trophic levels.},

This contribution represents the most recent and complete checklist of benthic organisms (mainly mega and macrofauna) that summarized 240 taxa collected at three sites in the mentioned area. The benthic richness here documented largely exceeds the values coming from other productive areas in Argentinean waters. Faunistic composition was different among the sites, although several species were shared. Bryozoans presented the highest richness compared to the other groups, followed by mollusks and sponges. These data represent valuable information and a very helpful starting point for incoming research, conservation efforts and management. It is essential to establish the spatial distribution of indicator taxa, like corals, sponges and bryozoans, to better attempt at the protection of benthic biodiversity in this rich Argentinean marine system. This is a key issue considering the notable extension of the MPA compared to other areas in Argentina, the bathymetric variations, particular oceanographic conditions and different fishing circumstances within the area.},

This information was acquired during two research cruises with RV Puerto Deseado (Argentina) during 2016 and 2017. Marine animal forests were detected in the study area: coral gardens, mainly composed of alcyonaceans, were detected in the south and west of Burdwood Bank (MPA Namuncur\'a II) and neighbouring areas, whereas pennatulacean aggregations were detected in the north-west of the plateau. The three-dimensional structures of live but also dead corals provide substrate and refuge to many associated species. Benthic communities dominated by sponges were also recorded between 200 and 300 m in depth. Six sites that meet the characteristics of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) are reported. Conservation strategies applied to scarcely known austral Argentinean waters led to the establishment of a pioneer MPA (Namuncur\'a I). Following the management plan that aimed to establish the biodiversity of Namuncur\'a I and neighbouring areas, the area of protection has now been enlarged to include the southern slope of the bank (currently Namuncur\'a II), where marine animal forests were detected, at depths below 200 m. The data presented here provide empirical evidence to support the conservation value of the region.},

We used quali- and quantitative data obtained from research cruises developed by Argentina in 2016 and 2017. The results showed that Porifera was the most important component (in terms of wet biomass) of these benthic communities, followed by Cnidaria and Echinodermata. The evidences regarding general composition of the main taxonomical groups of the benthic invertebrate community did not support the maintenance of the original zoning of the MPA (core, buffer, and transition), considering that only a weak differentiation was found among the sub-areas designed in the creation Law. Additionally, the analyzed evidences also demonstrated that this MPA was different from other neighboring areas. Vulnerable and fragile organisms recorded in many locations led to the detection of fourteen sites located inside the MPA Namuncur\'a that meet the characteristics of VMEs (wet biomass of\,{$\geq$}\,10~kg 1200~m-2 of vulnerable and fragile species). These evidences reinforce the conservation value of these particular and susceptible sub-Antarctic benthic communities, composed of both Antarctic and Magellanic species.},

There exist some encouraging applications, but few details are known about the relationships between centrality measurements and trophic levels. In addition, these studies almost refer to unweighted trophic networks, despite the acknowledged need of investigating weighted webs. Here we aim to contribute to the synthetic treatment of these complementary issues by analyzing several indices of centrality and trophic level. Studying 19 ecosystems, we ranked the nodes according to their positional importance values (based on various centrality indices) and we compared the rank order of coefficients with unweighted or weighted trophic levels. Our goal was revealing potential biases in finding high centrality nodes among basal, intermediate and top species. We found that key species occupy intermediate positions of the trophic hierarchy. In case of unweighted data, trophic levels of key nodes do not deviate from trends displayed by the whole dataset. Significant differences were observed when using weighted data. These results contradict the common belief of many ecologists that identified top-predators and charismatic megafauna as main targets of conservation policies. We discuss the potential consequences of the observed features on ecosystem dynamics.},

While invasive species are most often studied in the context of one or two trophic levels, in reality species invade communities comprised of complex food webs. The complexity and integrity of the native food web may be a more important determinant of invasion success than the strength of interactions between a small subset of species within a larger food web. Previous efforts to understand the relationship between food web properties and species invasions have been primarily theoretical and have yielded mixed results. Here, we present a synthesis of empirical information on food web connectance and species invasion success gathered from different sources (estimates of food web connectance from the primary literature and estimates of invasion success from the Global Invasive Species Database as well as the primary literature). Our results suggest that higher-connectance food webs tend to host fewer invaders and exert stronger biotic resistance compared to low-connectance webs. We argue that while these correlations cannot be used to infer a causal link between food web connectance and habitat invasibility, the promising findings beg for further empirical research that deliberately tests for relationships between food web connectance and invasion.},

The current study aimed to evaluate the spatial distribution of the abundance, biomass, community structure, and functional diversity of the mesozooplankton from the NMPA/BB during spring 2014. We also assessed the potential of zooplankton as prey for upper trophic levels, in particular the larvae of the Fuegian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), a key species in the food web of the NMPA/BB. A total of 26 zooplankton taxa were identified. Nauplii and copepods evidenced the highest abundances, with the latter representing the dominant group in terms of biomass. Copepods showed a strong eastward gradient in their abundance, biomass, and diversity. This spatial structure in the community composition seems to be modulated by a west-to-east decreasing trend in the size of available preys, with nano- and picoplankton playing a major role in the eastern part of the NMPA/BB. Such pattern would be, in turn, a consequence of productivity gradients along hydrographic features. The high abundance of nauplii and copepods suggests that spring is an appropriate time for their reproduction and, given their size structure, they represent an adequate food source for Fuegian sprat larvae. This would be enhanced by anticyclonic cells present in the NMPA/BB, which can gather and retain sprat larvae along with their zooplanktonic preys. The results of our study, which is the first comprehensive approach addressing the zooplanktonic indicators of the NMPA/BB, serve as a baseline for future ecosystem-based policies aiming to manage and protect the natural marine resources sheltered here.},

  abstract = {Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.},

To date, many dynamic studies of food-web behaviour\textemdash both empirical and theoretical\textemdash have focused on smaller sub-webs, called trophic modules, because these modules are more tractable experimentally and analytically than whole food webs. The question remains to what degree studies of trophic modules are relevant to infer the persistence of entire food webs. Four trophic modules have received particular attention in the literature: tri-trophic food chains, omnivory, exploitative competition, and apparent competition. Here, we integrate analysis of these modules' dynamics in isolation with those of whole food webs to directly assess the appropriateness of scaling from modules to food webs. We find that there is not a direct, one-to-one, relationship between the relative persistence of modules in isolation and their effect on persistence of an entire food web. Nevertheless, we observe that those modules which are most commonly found in empirical food webs are those that confer the greatest community persistence. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there may be significant dynamic justifications for empirically-observed food-web structure.},

A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.},

The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness.

In contrast, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non\textemdash drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable.

This latter component has not been incorporated directly into management, so here, we consider variability in the krill fishery at South Georgia, relating it to physical and biological monitoring indices, finding sea surface temperature to be a key correlate with both annual catch and long-term biological indices. Some indices from krill predators showed significant positive relationships with krill harvesting in the preceding winter, presumably indicative of the importance of winter foraging conditions. We explore how ecological structure affects results, examining two monitoring sites 100\,km apart. Results suggest different biological conditions at the two sites, probably reflecting different scales of ecosystem operation, emphasizing that an appreciation of scale will enhance krill fishery management. Finally, in reviewing different drivers of ecological change, we identify important additional monitoring that would help better reflect ecosystem status, improve the utility of CEMP, providing information necessary for the ecosystem approach at South Georgia.},

Based on stomach content analyses of 441 specimens ranging from 38 to 190~cm total length (TL), our study tested the hypotheses that diet was influenced by TL, sex, maturity stage, depth, and region, using generalized linear models and information theory selection criteria. The Patagonian toothfish fed primarily on fish (morid cod Notophycis marginata, myctophids, rattails Macrourus holotrachys and Coelorinchus fasciatus, notothenids Patagonotothen ramsayi, and hoki Macruronus magellanicus), followed by cephalopods (Onykia ingens, Doryteuthis gahi) and shrimps (Acanthephyra pelagica). One case of cannibalism was recorded. The trophic level was 4.57 (4.22 juveniles, 4.78 adults). The pelagic fish and bathypelagic shrimp were more consumed in the east region, whereas demersal fish and cephalopods were more consumed in the west one. Ontogenetic dietary changes associated with TL and maturity stage were reported: pelagic fish and shrimp A. pelagica had the main importance in the diet of intermediate-sized toothfish, reinforcing the hypothesis that juveniles exhibited a bento-pelagic behavior. Demersal fish were more heavily consumed by juvenile specimens, and the size of demersal fish predated by Patagonian toothfish increased according to the predator TL. Cephalopods were more consumed by adults. The preference of sexually mature specimens for cephalopods could have a positive effect on spawning and egg quality.},

The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks.

  abstract = {Body size determines a host of species traits that can affect the structure and dynamics of food webs, and other ecological networks, across multiple scales of organization. Measuring body size provides a relatively simple means of encapsulating and condensing a large amount of the biological information embedded within an ecological network. Recently, important advances have been made by incorporating body size into theoretical models that explore food web stability, the patterning of energy fluxes, and responses to perturbations. Because metabolic constraints underpin body-size scaling relationships, metabolic theory offers a potentially useful new framework within which to develop novel models to describe the structure and functioning of ecological networks and to assess the probable consequences of biodiversity change.},
