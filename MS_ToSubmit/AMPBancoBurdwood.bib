  abstract = {Neritic fronts are very abundant in austral South America, covering several scales of space and time. However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile\textendash Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.},

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics.

  abstract = {Food chains are short, rarely more than five trophic levels long. The cause of this pattern remains unresolved, and no current hypothesis fully explains this phenomenon. We offer an explanation based on the stability of food chains that have been shifted away from linearity to be more web-like. We start with a simple example of food webs of two to six species arranged so that species consume all those with a trophic level less than their own. The probability of stability, for such ``universal omnivory'' chains declined strongly with chain length, and was as low as 1\% with six level chains but highest for two and three level chains. We further explored the influence of chain length on food web stability by testing food webs with varying levels of connectance that were constructed either randomly or with the niche model. By additionally altering the relative impacts of predators on prey, and vice-versa, we test the role of our assumptions on the relationship between chain length and stability. Food webs characterized by low to moderate degrees of connectance, asymmetrical interactions, and relatively weak density dependence showed a pattern of reduced stability with longer trophic chains. The simple view that food webs characterized by long trophic chains are less stable seems to resolve the long-standing question of why there are so few trophic levels in nature.},

As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of ``gray areas'' between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

This study evaluated for the first time the occurrence of microplastics in benthic organisms from the Marine Protected Area Namuncur\'a at Burdwood Bank, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Microplastics were isolated from the soft tissue of the sea stars Henricia obesa and Odontaster penicillatus using an oxidative treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The chemical composition of the particles was identified with Raman spectroscopy. Fibers and fragments were found in similar proportions in both species. Fibers were identified as semi-synthetic cellulose, while the polymeric composition of fragments was masked by the synthetic pigment Phthalo blue. Over half of the sea stars contained microplastics (61\%). In H. obesa, the mean abundance was 1.00\,{$\pm$}\,1.03 particles per individual and 3.34\,{$\pm$}\,4.13 particles per gram, and in O. penicillatus, the mean abundance was 2.70\,{$\pm$}\,2.91 particles per individual and 1.94\,{$\pm$}\,2.09 particles per gram. Fibers were predominantly blue, and all fragments were bluish/turquoise. Microplastic sizes ranged from 24 to 1340~\textmu m, and most particles (approximately 90\%) were less than 1~mm. These results provide a baseline assessment of the abundance and type of microplastics in benthic organisms from this sub-Antarctic protected area and contribute to the scant data on microplastic pollution in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

We found a site-specific pattern of Hg transfer and biomagnification processes, while the oceanic BB showed major Hg transfer through the pelagic domain, coastal sectors (BC and AC-TDF) indicate a general biodilution process but with Hg concentrations incrementing with the benthivory grade. This represents a dissimilar Hg bioavailability for marine consumers that rely on different diet and forage in different habitats, and may become an issue of important conservation concern for these southern areas.},

This region is characterized by high biological productivity, and by an exceptional tidal regime that interacts with the subpolar Falkland/Malvinas (FM) current. The results presented contribute to the development of an ecohydrodynamic system intended for the study of the implications of increasing exploitation of natural resources in the region. Detailed tidal charts show the propagation on the continental shelf of tidal waves related to clockwise amphidromes in the South Atlantic, indicating the occurrence of resonance. The averaged velocity field is dominated by the FM current, although tidal residuals around headlands are significant on the Patagonian coast. In contrast, ``snapshots'' describe the interaction between the tides and the FM current, where the flow patterns displayed are expected to influence the population dynamics of biological species. The mean wind stress induces strong currents and a large anticlockwise circulation cell northeast of Tierra del Fuego. The strong tidal and FM currents generate shelf sea fronts whose locations, revealed by contours of the Simpson-Hunter parameter, are related to major fishing grounds. Because of the lack of velocity measurements in the region, the FM and wind-driven currents simulated by the model should be taken as experimental results until proper comparisons with observations can be made.},

The method thus yields a `cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks6,7,8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

Since species are components of food webs, one way to conceptualize and quantify species importance is from a network perspective. The importance of a species can be quantified by measuring the centrality of its position in a food web, because a central node may have greater influence on others in the network. A species may also be important because it has a unique network position, such that its loss cannot be easily compensated. Therefore, for a food web to be robust, we hypothesize that central species must be functionally redundant in terms of their network position. In this paper, we test our hypothesis by analysing the Prince William Sound ecosystem. We found that species centrality and uniqueness are negatively correlated, and such an observation is also carried over to other food webs.},

Symbioses between bryozoans and pagurid crabs are known from a wide latitudinal range, including tropical, warm- and cold-temperate regions. Here we describe Burdwoodipora paguricola gen. et sp. nov., a cheilostome bryozoan associated with pagurized shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus comptus White in subantarctic waters of the Southwest Atlantic. The association seems to be obligate, as the bryozoan was always found enlarging the last whorl of its gastropod substrate. The new species, however, is not species specific with regard to its shell substrate, as it was found to be associated with 31 species of gastropods with helicoidal coiling. Well-developed colonies may project up to 360\textdegree{} from the outer lip of the shell. The chamber built by the bryozoan is usually larger than the whorl that would have been generated by the gastropod. This is one of the few known cases of an obligate association between a bryozoan and a pagurid crab outside the ascophoran family Hippoporidridae and is also the first bryozoan/hermit crab symbiosis documented in the subantarctic region. The inclusion of Burdwoodipora in the Pacificincolidae, a family currently represented by just four species from the Northern Hemisphere, is discussed.},

This scaling contradicts the widely accepted link-species scaling law, which asserts that links increase linearly with the number of species and that the link-species exponent is one.

Tidal forcing is the main driver for the entrainment of deep waters into the upper layers of the bank and local wind forcing for the detrainment of these waters into the deep ocean. Passive tracer diagnostics suggest that the dynamical processes triggered by the Burdwood Bank could have a significant impact on local ecosystems and the biogeochemical balance of the southwestern Atlantic region, which is one of the most fertile portions of the Southern Ocean. Model results are robust\textemdash they are reproduced in a wide array of model configurations\textemdash but there is insufficient observational evidence to corroborate them. Satellite color imagery does not show substantial chlorophyll blooms in this region but it shows strong phytoplankton plumes emanating from the bank.

Although, early food web data appeared to verify this, recently many ecologists have found omnivory to be ubiquitous in food web data gathered at a high taxonomic resolution. In this paper, we re\textendash investigate the role of omnivory in food webs using a non\textendash equilibrium perspective. We find that the addition of omnivory to a simple food chain model (thus a simple food web) locally stabilizes the food web in a very complete way. First, non\textendash equilibrium dynamics (e.g. chaos) tend to be eliminated or bounded further away from zero via period\textendash doubling reversals invoked by the omnivorous trophic link. Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

Food webs play a central role in the debates on the role of complexity in stability, persistence, and resilience. Better empirical data and the exploding interest in the subject of networks across social, physical, and natural sciences prompted creation of this volume. The book explores the boundaries of what is known of the relationship between structure and dynamics in ecological networks and defines directions for future developments in this field.},

These major contributors to the low salinity intermediate water mass are advected northward along the continental slope of South America. The lower density water type enters the Argentine Basin both east and west of Burdwood Bank. Its thermohaline characteristics are modified by winter sea-air interaction near Burdwood Bank and mixing with the surrounding waters further north. The denser water type flows east of Burdwood Bank, undergoing salinity decrease, primarily by isopycnal processes. Low salinity water, derived from the Polar Front, is introduced into a still denser horizon (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}), from along the axis of the cyclonic circulation feature described by the Malvinas Current and its return to the south. The thermohaline structure across the Malvinas Current is similar to the water mass zonation observed in the northern Drake Passage. In the vicinity of 38\textdegree S, the northward-flowing modified subantarctic water converges with subtropical thermocline water at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. The less dense subantarctic water spreads under the subtropical thermocline; however, the denser water (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}) of Polar Front origin is not found under the subtropical thermocline in the western South Atlantic. In general the salinity at the salinity minimum increases rapidly across the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, suggesting that the bulk of the subantarctic water advected into the region by the Malvinas Current turns towards the interior, spreading under the subtropical thermocline along a broader expanse of the South Atlantic.},

  abstract = {Understanding the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems has become a critical issue to assess the potential short- and long-term effects of natural and anthropogenic impacts and to determine the knowledge needed to conduct appropriate conservation actions. This goal can be achieved in part by acquiring more detailed food web information and evaluating the processes that shape food web structure and dynamics. Our main objective was to identify large-scale patterns in the organization of pelagic food webs that can be linked to a wasp-waist (WW) structure, proposed for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. We evaluated 3 sub-Antarctic marine areas in a regional context: the Beagle Channel (BC), the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego (CA) and the oceanic Burdwood Bank area (BB). We used carbon and nitrogen isotopic information of all functional trophic groups, ranging from primary producers to top predators, and analyzed them through stable isotope-based Bayesian analyses. We found that BC and BB have a more pronounced WW structure compared to CA. We identified species at mid to low trophic positions that play a key role in the trophodynamics of each marine area (e.g. Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, longtail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi and squat lobster Munida gregaria) and considered them as the most plausible WW species. The identification of the most influential species within food webs has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean.},

This contribution represents the most recent and complete checklist of benthic organisms (mainly mega and macrofauna) that summarized 240 taxa collected at three sites in the mentioned area. The benthic richness here documented largely exceeds the values coming from other productive areas in Argentinean waters. Faunistic composition was different among the sites, although several species were shared. Bryozoans presented the highest richness compared to the other groups, followed by mollusks and sponges. These data represent valuable information and a very helpful starting point for incoming research, conservation efforts and management. It is essential to establish the spatial distribution of indicator taxa, like corals, sponges and bryozoans, to better attempt at the protection of benthic biodiversity in this rich Argentinean marine system. This is a key issue considering the notable extension of the MPA compared to other areas in Argentina, the bathymetric variations, particular oceanographic conditions and different fishing circumstances within the area.},

  abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long\textemdash term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11\textemdash yr period and for the nine non\textemdash drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non\textemdash drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity\textemdash stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long\textemdash standing dispute.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
