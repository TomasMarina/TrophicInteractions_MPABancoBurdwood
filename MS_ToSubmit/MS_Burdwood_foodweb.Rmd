# Introduction

* Introduction to MPAs and MPA N-BB

The evidence of benefits provided by Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as well as the urgent need for ocean protection have driven an unprecedented increase in the number of MPAs worldwide in recent years [@Roberts2017; @Sala2018]. Globally, the total area of the world ocean designated under marine protection adds up to nearly 29,600,000 km^2^, distributed across nearly 18,444 MPAs and covering 8.16% of the ocean’s surface [@IUCN2023], and therefore approaching the 10% goal of the Convention of Biological Diversity [@CBD2004]. Despite this progress, recent reports have shown that effective protection has been overestimated because it includes areas that are not yet effectively protected (only declared) as well as areas that allow significant extractive activities [@Sala2018].

In the subAntarctic region, the level of protection is mainly associated to oceanic islands, such as South Georgia and the South Sandwich, Bouvet, Prince Edward, and Macquarie [@IUCN2023]. Interestingly, the case of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I (MPA N-BB), which forms the focus of this work, is unique since it is associated to a submarine plateau [@Reta2014]. Added to this, such MPA is part of a network of protected areas in the subAntarctic (i.e joining MPAs Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood II and Yaganes), that contribute to protect and strengthen the functioning of this southern region to maintain global ocean health.

* Ecological importance of MPA N-BB to the region

Many of these MPAs centre on the presence of particularly vulnerable, keystone, or charismatic species; the presence of large numbers (or proportions) of endemic species; and the presence of high biodiversity across taxonomic levels [@Hogg2016]. Indeed, the MPA N-BB has been created because it is considered a biodiversity hotspot, mostly of its benthic community [@Schejter2016; @Falabella2017]. It is characterized by a high biomass of vulnerable and fragile species (mainly Porifera and Cnidaria) that meet the characteristics of vulnerable marine ecosystems [@Schejter2021], here defined as sites that present taxa with a minimum biomass of 10 kg per 1200 m^2^ [@CommissionfortheConservationofAntarcticMarineLivingResources2009]. Also, the benthic community provides habitat to several small-sized species [@Lopez-Gappa2018; @MartinSirito2019; @Schejter2019], and has an important role in the life history of fishes as a food source, refuge, or nursery area [@GarciaAlonso2018; @Delpiani2020; @Troccoli2020]. The maintenance of this singular community is related to the oceanographic processes, including the circulation of the rich Malvinas (Falkland) current in the area [@Piola1989; @Guerrero1999] and the upwelling and mixing phenomena [@Matano2019]. The input of nutrients coming from the Malvinas (Falkland) current also supports a diverse plankton community [@Guinder2020]. Overall, 811 benthic and planktonic species have been identified for the MPA N-BB ecosystem, where 349 were reported for the first time for the MPA [@APN2022]. At the ecosystem level the MPA N-BB is ascribed as a carbon-sinker [@Bergagna2019].

* Trophic ecology & keystone spp knowledge of B Burdwood

The structure and functioning of ecosystems can be successfully described by studying one of the most-frequent interactions occurring between species: the predator-prey relationship [@Bascompte2009]. The predator-prey or trophic interactions of a particular region are commonly referred as the food web, that represents the roadmap for matter and energy flow in an ecosystem.
The trophic structure of the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean has been proposed to be under a 'wasp-waist' control, meaning that the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem is regulated primarily by mid-trophic level species (e.g. fishes, crustaceans) [@Padovani2012; @Saporiti2015; @Riccialdelli2020]. In particular, the ecosystem of the MPA N-BB shows a more pronounced 'wasp-waist' structure than other subAntarctic areas, like the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego, where the Fuegian sprat *Sprattus fuegensis* and longtail southern cod *Patagonotothen ramsayi* are considered the most plausible 'wasp-waist' species [@Riccialdelli2020].
Recently, the identification of the most influential species within food webs has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean [@Franco2020; @Bergagna2020; @Riccialdelli2020].

* Why using a network approach

In the past decades, several researches have shown that high-latitude marine ecosystems, such as the MPA N-BB, are characterised by an unexpected complexity in terms of biodiversity and ecological interactions [@Day2013; @Kortsch2019; @Cordone2020; @Trathan2021].

Anthropogenic and climate-induced impacts are known to affect individual species, but they can also change the interactions that each species has with its prey and predators (Constable et al. 2014, Lynam et al. 2017).


* Objective

In the present work we present the first, detailed analysis of the food web for the MPA N-BB ecosystem. For this we applied a network approach to a highly-resolved food web. The objective was twofold: characterise the food web in terms of complexity and structure, and describe the species' role in such network framework.


# Methodology

## Study area

The MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I is a shallow submarine plateau called Burdwood Bank (BB) located 150 km east of Isla de los Estados and 200 km south from Malvinas/Falkland Islands (Figure 1). It comprises nearly 34,000 km^2^ circumscribed by the 200 m isobath, between 54º–55ºS and 56º–62ºW, with a slight slope extended nearly 370 km east–west. The BB is surrounded by steep flanks of more than 3000 m depth through which strong currents circulate [@Piola1989; @Reta2014; @Matano2019]. Intense upwelling and mixing occur over it, entraining deep nutrient rich waters into the photic layer [@Piola2009; @Matano2019], and resulting in a fairly homogeneous water column both spatially and temporally [@Glorioso1995; @Guerrero1999; @Matano2019]. Physical features in the MPAN-BB are fairly stable, with salinity averaging 34 all year round and temperature ranging between 4 and 8ºC overall [@Guerrero1999; @Acha2004; @Piola2009].

## Network construction

In order to build the network of predator-prey interactions we reviewed more than 150 references considering published articles, databases and doctoral theses. Furthermore, we took into account personal communications from experts belonging to the working group of the study area (https://www.pampazul.gob.ar/tag/banco-burdwood/). The diversity of the expertise of the authors contributing to the present study was a key factor in enhancing the quality of the network, and inherently improved the network representation of the MPA Namuncurá-Banco Burdwood ecosystem. A list of the references used to build the network is presented in Supplementary Material (Table S1).

Due to a lack of trophic data resolution for some species inhabiting the MPA Namuncurá-Banco Burdwood, we followed the concept of trophic species, here defined as aggregated groups of taxa. In most cases we followed this when data on specific biological species were not available, but for some cases we collapsed species when taxa shared the same set of predators and prey (trophic similarity criteria). Details about this can be found in Supplementary Material (Table S2).

With the gathered trophic data we constructed an interaction matrix of pairwise interactions; a value of 1 or 0 was assigned to each element a_ij of the matrix depending on whether the j-species preyed or not on the i-species. Then we transformed such matrix into an oriented graph with L trophic interactions between S nodes or species. The orientation or direction of the graph follows the flow of energy and matter in the network, from prey to predator.

## Network analysis

We analysed the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood network of trophic interactions, hereafter food web, at two levels: A) network, considering species and interactions of the whole network; and B) species, considering interactions and species related to a particular species. The network-level analysis aims to characterise the network of trophic interactions in terms of complexity and structure. For this we calculated several network properties commonly used to describe empirical food webs [@Pascual2005]: (1) number of species S; (2) number of interactions or links L; (3) link density L/S; (4) Connectance L/S^2; (5) omnivory Omn; and (6) shortest path length SPL. Also, we estimated the (7) degree distributions for the food web, for prey and predators, and for each functional group (e.g. Amphipoda, Ascidiacea, Bivalvia, Fish, Marine mammals, Sea birds, etc.) (Table 1). The prey and predator distributions indicate the frequency of prey among predators, and viceversa; the functional group's degree shows the distribution of interactions within groups.
The species-level analysis aims to describe the species' role in the food web. For this we considered the following properties: (1) betweenness Btw; (2) closeness Cl; (3) trophic similarity TS; (4) topological role TR; and (5) trophic level TL (Table 1). We also studied the relationship between species TL and the other species properties by performing linear regression analyses. Thus, we considered the TL as the dependent variable and the given property as the independent variable, and obtained the coefficients (slope and intercept) for the linear model. Models were fitted using the least squares approach. We also explored the topological role categories with the species TL.
These species-level properties provide a general appropriate description of species' role in empirical complex food webs [@Cirtwill2018].

All network analyses and graphs were performed in R version 4.2.2 [@RCoreTeam2022], mainly using 'igraph' [@Csardi2006] and ‘multiweb’ [@Saravia2022a] packages. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/TomasMarina/Banco-Burdwood.

# Results

## Network-level properties

In terms of complexity, the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web consisted of 1778 predator-prey interactions and 379 species, where 93% of them were defined at the species taxonomical level (Figure 2, Table S2). The food web presented a link density of 4.69, meaning the average number of interactions per species, and a connectance of 0.01. Almost half of the consumers were omnivores, feeding on sources at different trophic levels. The food web showed a path length of 2.99, which implies that nearly three interactions are needed to connect any pair of species of the network (Table 1).

```

The degree distribution of the food web showed an asymmetric frequency in the number of interactions, where most of the species had a relatively low number of interactions and few species concentrated the majority of them (Figure 3A). The distribution of prey among predators showed that most of the consumers fed on a low number of prey whereas few of them had multiple preys (Figure 3B). These were the top-five predators in number of prey: *Patagonotothen guntheri* (Notothenioid fish, 52 prey), *Patagonotothen ramsayi* (Notothenioid fish, 50 prey), *Dissostichus eleginoides* (Notothenioid fish, 30 prey), *Bathyraja brachyurops* (Chondrichthyan, 30 prey), and *Bathyraja griseocauda* (Chondrichthyan, 28 prey). Following the same distribution pattern, few prey presented multiple predators (Figure 3C). These were the top-five prey in number of predators: Detritus (Non-living, 153 predators), the three categories of Diatoms considered (benthic, centric and pennate, 72 predators on average), and species of the genus *Euphausia* (Zooplankton, 46 predators). Finally, taking into account the interactions within each functional group, again the majority of the interactions were concentrated in few species (Figure 3D). The most evident species were: *Themisto gaudichaudii* (Amphipoda), *Zygochlamys patagonica* (Bivalvia), *Aspidostoma giganteum* (Bryozoa), *Munida gregaria* (Decapoda), *Patagonotothen ramsayi* and *Patagonotothen guntheri* (bentho-pelagic fish), *Psychrolutes marmoratus* (demersal fish), and species of *Euphausia* (Zooplankton).
Overall, there is an evident asymmetry in the distribution of interactions among species at different levels in the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web.

A list of the distribution of interactions per species is presented in Supplementary Material (Table S3).

## Species-level properties

The majority of the species of the food web were consumers, 336 out of 379; the rest were primary producers, such as diatoms (phytoplankton), and non-living food sources like detritus and necromass.

We found different relationships between the species trophic level (TL) and the rest of the analysed species-level properties (Figure 4A-D). In this regard, the most evident significant relationship was with trophic similarity, i.e. the higher the species' TL, the lower the trophic similarity or the higher the uniqueness in terms of trophic role (Figure 4C). Here it's noteworthy to highlight high-trophic level species with low values of trophic similarity: *Bathyraja macloviana* and *Squalus acanthias* (Chondrichthyans), *Diplopteraster clarki* and *Pteraster sp* (echinoderms), *Phalacrocorax_atriceps* and *Eudyptes chrysocome* (sea birds), and *Lagenorhynchus cruciger* and *Mesoplodon bowdoini* (marine mammals) (Table S3).

We also found a negative significant relationship with closeness, however less evident, meaning that low-TL species are relatively closer to any other species in the food web (Figure 4B). Species of genera *Calanus* and *Euphausia*, and species of Brachiopoda, all of them with TL < 3, registered the highest values of closeness (Table S3).

It's noteworthy that the highest values of betweenness were shown by species of mid-TLs (3-4), meaning that those species participated in the highest number of shortest paths between species (Figure 4A). These were the species with the highest values: *Patagonotothen ramsayi*, *Dissostichus eleginoides*, *Salilota australis* (fishes), *Doryteuthis gahi* (Cephalopoda), and *Patagonotothen guntheri* (Notothenioid fish) (Table S3).

Taking into account the topological role, 'module specialist' species were the most frequent and presented a wide TL range (1 - 4.77); 'module hub' was constrained to mid-TL species (2.48 - 3.92); 'module connector' from low to mid-TLs (1 - 3.86); and 'network connector', the least frequent, had all of its species in TL = 1, except for one with TL = 3.47 (Figure 4D, see Figure S2 for species' topological roles in a food web graph framework). Here it's important to highlight species of the two latter topological roles, because they are responsible for linking modules and maintaining the connectivity of the food web: 40 species (5 network connectors + 35 module connectors) from 20 different functional groups with a TL range = 1 - 3.86.

An exhaustive list of the species-level properties is presented in Supplementary Material (Table S3).

# Discussion

## The MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web

* The MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web is one of the most highly-resolved networks of trophic interactions described for subpolar and polar regions.
Compare network-level properties with other subpolar and polar food webs.

* The food web shows an asymmetry in the distribution of interactions at several levels: food web, functional group, prey and predators. In all of them interactions are concentrated in a few species.
On one hand, this asymmetry indicates that most consumers have a narrow diet, and few present flexible diets (*Patagonotothen guntheri*, *P. ramsayi*, *Dissostichus eleginoides*, *Bathyraja brachyurops*, *B. griseocauda*).
On the other hand few prey are consumed by many predators, meaning that there are dominant food sources from which most consumers depend on: detritus, diatoms (benthic, centric, pennate), and species of *Euphausia*.

## Species' role

Our results state that certain species play particular roles in the structure of the food web.

* Betweenness. Species at mid-trophic levels (3-4) lie in more shortest paths between species than any other species: ‘bridge’ role. Implications for spread of perturbations like mercury [@Fioramonti2022], microplastics [@Cossi2021].

* Closeness. Low-trophic level species are relatively closer to other species in the food web. Apart from the most demanded food sources (i.e. detritus), which are logically closer to many species, unexpected consumers arise as important in this regard. Species of the zooplankton community like *Calanus* and *Euphausia* are crucial for the food web functioning, since they can affect others more quickly.

* Trophic similarity. Species are more similar at low and mid-trophic levels (2-4). There is a functional redundancy at these levels of the food web. On the other hand, less trophic similarity at high TLs indicate uniqueness in terms of trophic role. This highlights the importance of top predators in the sense that they play a role that cannot be played by any other species.

* Topological role. Low and mid-trophic level species (TL = 1 - 3.86) are responsible for maintaining the connectivity of the food web (network connector and module connector). The functional groups represented are: Amphipoda, Bivalvia, Bryozoa, Cnidaria, Cumacea, Decapoda, Detritus, Diatoms, Echinodermata, Fish (bentho-pelagic, demersal, chondrichthyes), Foraminifera, Polychaeta, Porifera, Zooplankton. This shows that the structure of the food web depends on a diversity of species, which at the end comprise the ecosystem's diversity.

* Overall, low and mid-trophic level species arise as crucial in the structure of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web, since they present the highest betweenness and closeness values, and the most important topological roles. This coincides with a recent study that suggest a wasp-waist trophic structure for the region [@Riccialdelli2020]. However, we also suggest that there exists functional redundancy at mid-trophic levels.
Furthermore, our study points out species of high-trophic levels due to its uniqueness role.

## Caveats and future perspectives

Caveats:

* Seasonal variation in predators' diet due to food source availability.

* Spatial variation of study area: Banco Burdwood west-east gradient.

* The lack of density or biomass data might have neglected well-known important species for the structure of the food web: *Sprattus fuegensis*.

Perspectives:

* Estimation of interaction strength to gain insights into food web stability and response to anthropogenic and environmental perturbations.

* Simulate perturbations on food web and target species: mercury transfer, microplastic pollution, fisheries.
