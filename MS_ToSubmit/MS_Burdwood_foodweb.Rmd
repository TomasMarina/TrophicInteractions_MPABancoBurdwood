# Introduction

The evidence of benefits provided by Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as well as the urgent need for ocean protection have driven an unprecedented increase in the number of MPAs worldwide in recent years [@Roberts2017; @Sala2018]. Globally, the total area of the world ocean designated under marine protection adds up to nearly 29,600,000 km^2^, distributed across nearly 18,444 MPAs and covering 8.16% of the ocean’s surface [@IUCN2023], and therefore approaching the 10% goal of the Convention of Biological Diversity [@CBD2004]. Despite this progress, recent reports have shown that effective protection has been overestimated because it includes areas that are not yet effectively protected (only declared) as well as areas that allow significant extractive activities [@Sala2018].

In the subAntarctic region, the level of protection is mainly associated to oceanic islands, such as South Georgia and the South Sandwich, Bouvet, Prince Edward, and Macquarie [@IUCN2023]. Interestingly, the case of the MPAs Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I and II (MPA N-BB), which forms the focus of this work, is unique since they are associated to a submarine plateau and the southern adjacent deep slope region, respectively [@Falabella2017]. Added to this, such MPAs are part of a network of protected areas in the subAntarctic (jointly with MPA Yaganes), that contributes to protect and strengthen the functioning of this southern region to maintain global ocean health.

Many of these MPAs centre on the presence of particularly vulnerable, keystone, or charismatic species; the presence of large numbers (or proportions) of endemic species; and the presence of high biodiversity across taxonomic levels [@Hogg2016]. Indeed, the MPA N-BB was created to protect a sensitive and biodiverse benthic habitat that was barely known [@Schejter2016; @Falabella2017]. The benthic community is featured by a high biomass of vulnerable and fragile species (mainly Porifera and Cnidaria) that meet the characteristics of vulnerable marine ecosystems [@Schejter2021], here defined as sites that present taxa with a minimum biomass of 10 kg per 1200 m^2^ [@CommissionfortheConservationofAntarcticMarineLivingResources2009]. Also, it provides habitat to several small-sized species [@Lopez-Gappa2018; @MartinSirito2019; @Schejter2019], and has an important role in the life history of fishes as a food source, refuge, or nursery area [@GarciaAlonso2018; @Delpiani2020; @Troccoli2020]. The maintenance of this singular community is related to the oceanographic processes, including the circulation of the rich Malvinas (Falkland) current in the area [@Piola1989; @Guerrero1999] and the upwelling and mixing phenomena [@Matano2019]. The input of nutrients coming from the Malvinas (Falkland) current also supports a diverse plankton community [@Guinder2020]. Overall, 811 benthic and plankton species have been identified for the MPA N-BB ecosystem, where 349 were reported for the first time for the area [@APN2022].

Recently, the identification of the most influential species has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean [@Franco2020; @Bergagna2020; @Riccialdelli2020].
In this regard, the structure of the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean has been proposed to be under a 'wasp-waist' control, meaning that the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem is regulated primarily by mid-trophic level species (e.g. fishes, crustaceans) [@Padovani2012; @Saporiti2015; @Riccialdelli2020]. In particular, the ecosystem of the MPA N-BB shows a more pronounced 'wasp-waist' structure than other subAntarctic areas, like the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego. The Fuegian sprat *Sprattus fuegensis* and longtail southern cod *Patagonotothen ramsayi* are considered the most plausible 'wasp-waist' species [@Riccialdelli2020].

High-latitude marine ecosystems, such as the MPA N-BB, are characterised by an unexpected complexity in terms of biodiversity and ecological interactions [@Day2013; @Kortsch2019; @Cordone2020; @Trathan2021]. Although there is a robust knowledge about the complexity considering the richness of the benthic and plankton communities in the MPA N-BB ecosystem [@Schejter2016; @Guinder2020; @Schejter2020; @APN2022], there is a need for a better understanding of species interactions' complexity and structure.
This aspect can be tackled by analysing one of the most-frequent relationships occurring between species: the predator-prey interaction [@Bascompte2009]. The sum of predator-prey or trophic interactions of a particular region is referred to as a food web, which represents the roadmap for matter and energy flow in an ecosystem.
In recent years, network approaches have been successfully applied to study complex high-latitude marine ecosystems, improving our knowledge on structure, functioning, and respond to environmental/anthropogenic changes [@Kortsch2015; @Cordone2018; @Funes2022; @Marina2023]. Here it is worth mentioning that anthropogenic threats have been recently reported for the MPA N-BB region [@Cossi2021; @Fioramonti2022].

In the present work we present the first, detailed analysis of the network of predator-prey interactions, hereafter food web, for the MPA N-BB ecosystem. For this we applied a network approach to a highly-resolved food web. The objective was twofold: characterise the food web in terms of complexity and structure, and identify the species' role in such network framework.


# Methodology

## Study area

The MPAs Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I and II, created by National Laws 26875 and 27490, comprise a shallow submarine plateau called Burdwood Bank (BB) and a deep slope that reaches 4000 m in depth, respectively [@APN2023]. They are located 150 km east of Isla de los Estados and 200 km south from Malvinas/Falkland Islands (Figure 1).
The MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I comprises nearly 34,000 km^2^ circumscribed by the 200 m isobath, between 54º–55ºS and 56º–62ºW, with a slight slope extended nearly 370 km east–west. Physical features in the BB are fairly stable, with salinity averaging 34 all year round and temperature ranging between 4 and 8ºC overall [@Guerrero1999; @Acha2004; @Piola2009]. The BB is surrounded by steep flanks of up to 4000 m depth through which strong currents circulate [@Piola1989; @Reta2014; @Matano2019]. Such deep slope form the basis of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood II that protects about 32,000 km^2^. Intense upwelling and mixing occur over it, entraining deep nutrient rich waters into the photic layer [@Piola2009; @Matano2019], and resulting in a fairly homogeneous water column both spatially and temporally [@Glorioso1995; @Guerrero1999; @Matano2019].

Given the evidence collected during several research cruises about the oceanographic and ecological processes connecting MPAs Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I and II [references in @APN2022], a joint management plan was recently proposed [@APN2022]. Three categories were defined according to the authorized activities: 1) Marine National Reserve (MNR), an area with the objective of conserving marine biodiversity, landscape quality and large-scale ecological processes, allowing scientific, educational, recreational uses and the sustainable use of one or more of its natural resources; 2) Marine National Park, an area with the objective of conserving marine biodiversity, landscape quality and large-scale ecological processes (MNP); and 3) Restricted Marine National Reserve (RMNR), an area of maximum permanent or temporary protection with the objective to preserve marine biodiversity and ecological processes in the long term, minimizing anthropogenic impact, and allowing scientific research and monitoring, as well as control and surveillance activities. Figure 1 shows the geographic location of these categories within MPAs Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood I and II.

## Network construction

In order to build the network of predator-prey interactions we reviewed more than 150 references considering published articles, databases and doctoral theses. Furthermore, we took into account personal communications from experts belonging to the working group of the study area (https://www.pampazul.gob.ar/tag/banco-burdwood/). The diversity of the expertise of the authors contributing to the present study was a key factor in enhancing the quality of the network, and inherently improved the network representation. A list of the references used to build the network is presented in Supplementary Material (Table S1).

Due to a lack of trophic data resolution for some species inhabiting the study area, we followed the concept of trophic species, here defined as aggregated groups of taxa. In most cases we followed it when specific data on species, in the taxonomic sense, were not available. In some cases we collapsed species when taxa shared the same set of predators and prey (trophic similarity, @Martinez1991), one of the aggregation methods that better preserves food web functional properties [@Gauzens2013]. Details about this can be found in Supplementary Material (Table S2).

With the gathered trophic data we constructed an interaction matrix of pairwise interactions; a value of 1 or 0 was assigned to each element a_ij of the matrix depending on whether the j-species preyed or not on the i-species. Then we transformed such matrix into an oriented graph with L trophic interactions between S nodes or species. The orientation or direction of the graph follows the flow of energy and matter in the network, from prey to predator.

## Network analysis

We analysed the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood network of trophic interactions, hereafter food web, at two levels: A) network, considering species and interactions of the whole network; and B) species, considering interactions and species related to a particular species. The network-level analysis aims to characterise the network of trophic interactions in terms of complexity and structure. For this we calculated several network properties commonly used to describe empirical food webs [@Pascual2005]: (1) number of species S; (2) number of interactions or links L; (3) link density L/S; (4) Connectance L/S^2; (5) omnivory Omn; and (6) small-world pattern. For the latter property, we calculated the characteristic path length and the clustering coefficient of the network, and we compared it to 1000 random networks generated with the same number of species and interactions [@Marina2018a].
Also, we estimated the (7) degree distributions for the food web, for prey and predators, and for each functional group (e.g. Amphipoda, Ascidiacea, Bivalvia, Fish, Marine mammals, Sea birds, etc.) (Table 1). The prey and predator distributions indicate the frequency of prey among predators, and viceversa; the functional group's degree shows the distribution of interactions within groups.
The species-level analysis aims to describe the species' role in the food web. For this we considered the following properties: (1) betweenness Btw; (2) closeness Cl; (3) trophic similarity TS; (4) topological role TR; and (5) trophic level TL (Table 1). We also studied the relationship between species TL and the other species properties by performing linear regression analyses. Thus, we considered the TL as the dependent variable and the given property as the independent variable, and obtained the coefficients (slope and intercept) for the linear model. Models were fitted using the least squares approach. We also explored the topological role categories with the species TL.
These species-level properties provide a general appropriate description of species' role in empirical complex food webs [@Cirtwill2018].

All network analyses and graphs were performed in R version 4.2.2 [@RCoreTeam2022], mainly using 'igraph' [@Csardi2006] and ‘multiweb’ [@Saravia2022a] packages. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/TomasMarina/Banco-Burdwood.

# Results

## Network-level properties

In terms of complexity, the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web consisted of 1778 predator-prey interactions and 379 species, where 93% of them were defined at the species taxonomical level (Figure 2, Table S2). The food web presented a link density of 4.69, meaning the average number of interactions per species, and a connectance of 0.01. Almost half of the consumers were omnivores, feeding on sources at different trophic levels. The food web displayed a small-world pattern, meaning that the path length was lower and the clustering coefficient was higher than the random networks (Table 1).

```

The degree distribution of the food web showed an asymmetric frequency in the number of interactions, where most of the species had a relatively low number of interactions and few species concentrated the majority of them (Figure 3A). The distribution of prey among predators showed that most of the consumers fed on a low number of prey whereas few of them had multiple preys (Figure 3B). These were the top-five predators in number of prey: *Patagonotothen guntheri* (Notothenioid fish, 52 prey), *Patagonotothen ramsayi* (Notothenioid fish, 50 prey), *Dissostichus eleginoides* (Notothenioid fish, 30 prey), *Bathyraja brachyurops* (Chondrichthyan, 30 prey), and *Bathyraja griseocauda* (Chondrichthyan, 28 prey). Following the same distribution pattern, few prey presented multiple predators (Figure 3C). These were the top-five prey in number of predators: Detritus (Non-living, 153 predators), the three categories of Diatoms considered (benthic, centric and pennate, 72 predators on average), and species of the genus *Euphausia* (Zooplankton, 46 predators). Finally, taking into account the interactions within each functional group, again the majority of the interactions were concentrated in few species (Figure 3D). The most evident species were: *Themisto gaudichaudii* (Amphipoda), *Zygochlamys patagonica* (Bivalvia), *Aspidostoma giganteum* (Bryozoa), *Munida gregaria* (Decapoda), *Patagonotothen ramsayi* and *Patagonotothen guntheri* (bentho-pelagic fish), *Psychrolutes marmoratus* (demersal fish), and species of *Euphausia* (Zooplankton).
Overall, there is an evident asymmetry in the distribution of interactions among species at different levels in the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web.

A list of the distribution of interactions per species is presented in Supplementary Material (Table S3).

## Species-level properties

The majority of the species of the food web were consumers, 336 out of 379; the rest were primary producers, such as diatoms (phytoplankton), and non-living food sources like detritus and necromass.

We found different relationships between the species trophic level (TL) and the rest of the analysed species-level properties (Figure 4A-D). In this regard, the most evident significant relationship was with trophic similarity, i.e. the higher the species' TL, the lower the trophic similarity or the higher the uniqueness in terms of trophic role (Figure 4C). Here it is noteworthy to highlight high-trophic level species with low values of trophic similarity: *Bathyraja macloviana* and *Squalus acanthias* (Chondrichthyans), *Diplopteraster clarki* and *Pteraster sp* (echinoderms), *Phalacrocorax_atriceps* and *Eudyptes chrysocome* (sea birds), and *Lagenorhynchus cruciger* and *Mesoplodon bowdoini* (marine mammals) (Table S3).

We also found a negative significant relationship with closeness, however less evident, meaning that low-TL species are relatively closer to any other species in the food web (Figure 4B). Species of genera *Calanus* and *Euphausia*, and species of Brachiopoda, all of them with TL < 3, registered the highest values of closeness (Table S3).

It is noteworthy that the highest values of betweenness were shown by species of mid-TLs (3-4), meaning that those species participated in the highest number of shortest paths between species (Figure 4A). These were the species with the highest values: *Patagonotothen ramsayi*, *Dissostichus eleginoides*, *Salilota australis* (fishes), *Doryteuthis gahi* (Cephalopoda), and *Patagonotothen guntheri* (Notothenioid fish) (Table S3).

Taking into account the topological role, 'module specialist' species were the most frequent and presented a wide TL range (1 - 4.77); 'module hub' was constrained to mid-TL species (2.48 - 3.92); 'module connector' from low to mid-TLs (1 - 3.86); and 'network connector', the least frequent, had all of its species in TL = 1, except for one with TL = 3.47 (Figure 4D, see Figure S2 for species' topological roles in a food web graph framework). Here it's important to highlight species of the two latter topological roles, because they are responsible for linking modules and maintaining the connectivity of the food web: 40 species (5 network connectors + 35 module connectors) from 20 different functional groups with a TL range = 1 - 3.86.

An exhaustive list of the species-level properties is presented in Supplementary Material (Table S3).

# Discussion

## The food web of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood ecosystem

The food web of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood ecosystem, analysed in this study, is one of the most highly-resolved networks of trophic interactions not only for a high-latitude marine ecosystem but also for a marine protected area worldwide. It is of paramount importance to consider the complexity of species interactions in order to gain insights into the structure and functioning of the ecosystem, since the aggregation of species might mask food web properties and/or produce type II errors (false positive) [@Martinez1993; @Gauzens2013].

Food web connectance is a property that resumes the complexity of the network. It contains important information regarding how interactions within an ecological network are distributed, and predicts reasonably well key dynamical properties of ecological networks  also many structural [@Dunne2002a]. More importantly, it is an emergent property of pairwise species interactions [@Poisot2014].
Complex marine food webs (i.e. with more than 25 trophic species) show connectance values ranging from 0.01 - 0.27 [@Marina2018a]. In particular, food webs from high-latitude regions tend to exhibit a connectance closer to the minimum (between 0.01 and 0.05) [@Santana2013; @Kortsch2015; @Rodriguez2022]. Whether food webs display low or high connectance values helps to better comprehend ecosystem's synthetic properties like robustness. In this sense, empirical analyses support the notion that the robustness of a food web increases with connectance [@Dunne2002; @Montoya2003]. The connectance of the food web of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood (0.01) is one of the lowest reported so far for these regions; five times lower than that of Beagle Channel [@Rodriguez2022]. 

The degree distribution or the distribution of number of interactions per species is the core for the structure of species interactions, which influences the opportunities for multiple species to persist in the long term and, therefore, their coexistence [@Godoy2018]. The food web for the MPA N-BB presents an asymmetric degree (interaction) distribution. This is a pattern that we have identified at different levels of analysis: food web, predator, prey, and functional group. Such asymmetry is a well-known feature in empirical complex food webs in particular [@Dunne2002a; @Montoya2003; @Stouffer2005], and has received great attention in complex networks in general [@Albert2002; @Newman2003].
The degree distribution pattern affects the resilience of complex food webs against random failures and intentional attacks: right-skewed distributions, like the one described in this study, are more vulnerable to the removal of the most-connected species or hubs with the potential of producing a catastrophic fragmentation of the network [@Albert2000; @Dunne2002].

Small-world
The path length, another network-level property we analysed, refers to the average shortest distance between pairs of species in the food web. A short path length implies a rapid spread of an impact (e.g. contaminant, population fluctuation, local extinction) throughout the network [@Williams2002]. In comparison to complex and empirical marine food webs, the food web of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood has a long path length (4th longest among 29 food webs) [@Marina2018a].

Omnivory



Low connectance, 
Right-skewed degree distribution

combined with vulnerable and fragile species and ongoing anthropogenic impacts [@Cossi2021; @Fioramonti2022], suggest potential ecosystem fragility which need to be addressed.





The degree distribution allows identification of important species, such as potential keystone species [@Sole2001; @Dunne2002], generalists, and specialist species [@Kondoh2010].


Considering the relevance of DD in network robustness we have considered this parameter in our analysis of food webs vulnerability to species loss. In particular we are interested in the intentional removal of certain species in the food web more than in the random extinction of species. 



* The MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web is one of the most highly-resolved networks of trophic interactions described for subpolar and polar regions.
Compare network-level properties with other subpolar and polar food webs.

* The food web shows an asymmetry in the distribution of interactions at several levels: food web, functional group, prey and predators. In all of them interactions are concentrated in a few species.
On one hand, this asymmetry indicates that most consumers have a narrow diet, and few present flexible diets (*Patagonotothen guntheri*, *P. ramsayi*, *Dissostichus eleginoides*, *Bathyraja brachyurops*, *B. griseocauda*).
On the other hand few prey are consumed by many predators, meaning that there are dominant food sources from which most consumers depend on: detritus, diatoms (benthic, centric, pennate), and species of *Euphausia*.

## Species' role

Our results state that certain species play particular roles in the structure of the food web.

* Betweenness. Species at mid-trophic levels (3-4) lie in more shortest paths between species than any other species: ‘bridge’ role. Implications for spread of perturbations like mercury [@Fioramonti2022], microplastics [@Cossi2021].

* Closeness. Low-trophic level species are relatively closer to other species in the food web. Apart from the most demanded food sources (i.e. detritus), which are logically closer to many species, unexpected consumers arise as important in this regard. Species of the zooplankton community like *Calanus* and *Euphausia* are crucial for the food web functioning, since they can affect others more quickly.

* Trophic similarity. Species are more similar at low and mid-trophic levels (2-4). There is a functional redundancy at these levels of the food web. On the other hand, less trophic similarity at high TLs indicate uniqueness in terms of trophic role. This highlights the importance of top predators in the sense that they play a role that cannot be played by any other species.

* Topological role. Low and mid-trophic level species (TL = 1 - 3.86) are responsible for maintaining the connectivity of the food web (network connector and module connector). The functional groups represented are: Amphipoda, Bivalvia, Bryozoa, Cnidaria, Cumacea, Decapoda, Detritus, Diatoms, Echinodermata, Fish (bentho-pelagic, demersal, chondrichthyes), Foraminifera, Polychaeta, Porifera, Zooplankton. This shows that the structure of the food web depends on a diversity of species, which at the end comprise the ecosystem's diversity.

* Overall, low and mid-trophic level species arise as crucial in the structure of the MPA Namuncurá - Banco Burdwood food web, since they present the highest betweenness and closeness values, and the most important topological roles. This coincides with a recent study that suggest a wasp-waist trophic structure for the region [@Riccialdelli2020]. However, we also suggest that there exists functional redundancy at mid-trophic levels.
Furthermore, our study points out species of high-trophic levels due to its uniqueness role.

## Caveats and future perspectives

Caveats:

Seasonal variation in predators' diet due to food source availability.
@Brose2019

Spatial variation of study area: Banco Burdwood west-east gradient.
@Kortsch2019

The lack of density or biomass data might have neglected well-known important species for the structure of the food web: *Sprattus fuegensis*.

Perspectives:

Incorporate habitat heterogeneity, since benthic community in the BB and deep flanks is different [@Schejter2021]. This might lead to distinct food web properties, hence differences in ecosystem functioning and response to anthropogenic and environmental perturbations.
@Cordone2020

Estimation of interaction strength considering species and interaction traits (i.e. body size, body mass, dimensionality) to gain insights into food web stability and response to anthropogenic and environmental perturbations.
@Nilsson2016; @Cirtwill2018; @Kortsch2021

Simulate perturbations on food web and target species: mercury transfer, microplastic pollution, fisheries.
@Cossi2021; @Fioramonti2022
