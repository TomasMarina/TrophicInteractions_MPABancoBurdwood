  abstract = {Neritic fronts are very abundant in austral South America, covering several scales of space and time. However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile\textendash Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.},

  abstract = {Many different concepts have been used to describe species' roles in food webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of ``gray areas'' between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

This region is characterized by high biological productivity, and by an exceptional tidal regime that interacts with the subpolar Falkland/Malvinas (FM) current. The results presented contribute to the development of an ecohydrodynamic system intended for the study of the implications of increasing exploitation of natural resources in the region. Detailed tidal charts show the propagation on the continental shelf of tidal waves related to clockwise amphidromes in the South Atlantic, indicating the occurrence of resonance. The averaged velocity field is dominated by the FM current, although tidal residuals around headlands are significant on the Patagonian coast. In contrast, ``snapshots'' describe the interaction between the tides and the FM current, where the flow patterns displayed are expected to influence the population dynamics of biological species. The mean wind stress induces strong currents and a large anticlockwise circulation cell northeast of Tierra del Fuego. The strong tidal and FM currents generate shelf sea fronts whose locations, revealed by contours of the Simpson-Hunter parameter, are related to major fishing grounds. Because of the lack of velocity measurements in the region, the FM and wind-driven currents simulated by the model should be taken as experimental results until proper comparisons with observations can be made.},

The upper 500 meters regime along the shelf break and around Malvinas Islands (48\textdegree{} to 55\textdegree{} S) is analyzed. In particular, the 1994 horizontal distribution of temperature, salinity and density was mapped in order to show the extreme winter pattern of these parameters. Three salinity sections crossing the water flow direction in the Malvinas Channel (South to the islands) were selected to describe the vertical stratification 1995 and 1995. Horizontal and vertical distribution of chlorophyll a from the 1995 cruise is presented as reference data, considering the lack of information on this parameter for the area. Finally, the inter-annual variability of the heat content in two 5\textdegree{} x 5\textdegree{} areas (East and West to the islands) is discussed by comparing the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data between the four sampled years. From this information, 1995 resulted in the coolest winter, presenting a temperature anomaly around -4\textdegree{} C respect to the other winters.},

  abstract = {Some bryozoan species occur on gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs, often dominating the shell surface to the exclusion of other encrusters. Symbioses between bryozoans and pagurid crabs are known from a wide latitudinal range, including tropical, warm- and cold-temperate regions. Here we describe Burdwoodipora paguricola gen. et sp. nov., a cheilostome bryozoan associated with pagurized shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus comptus White in subantarctic waters of the Southwest Atlantic. The association seems to be obligate, as the bryozoan was always found enlarging the last whorl of its gastropod substrate. The new species, however, is not species specific with regard to its shell substrate, as it was found to be associated with 31 species of gastropods with helicoidal coiling. Well-developed colonies may project up to 360\textdegree{} from the outer lip of the shell. The chamber built by the bryozoan is usually larger than the whorl that would have been generated by the gastropod. This is one of the few known cases of an obligate association between a bryozoan and a pagurid crab outside the ascophoran family Hippoporidridae and is also the first bryozoan/hermit crab symbiosis documented in the subantarctic region. The inclusion of Burdwoodipora in the Pacificincolidae, a family currently represented by just four species from the Northern Hemisphere, is discussed.},

  abstract = {A suite of high-resolution numerical simulations characterizes the oceanic circulation in the Burdwood Bank, a shallow seamount located in the northeastern end of the Drake Passage. Model analysis shows energetic upwelling and mixing uplifting deep and benthic waters into the photic layer. Tides and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are the primary drivers of the bank's circulation. Tidal forcing is the main driver for the entrainment of deep waters into the upper layers of the bank and local wind forcing for the detrainment of these waters into the deep ocean. Passive tracer diagnostics suggest that the dynamical processes triggered by the Burdwood Bank could have a significant impact on local ecosystems and the biogeochemical balance of the southwestern Atlantic region, which is one of the most fertile portions of the Southern Ocean. Model results are robust\textemdash they are reproduced in a wide array of model configurations\textemdash but there is insufficient observational evidence to corroborate them. Satellite color imagery does not show substantial chlorophyll blooms in this region but it shows strong phytoplankton plumes emanating from the bank. There are several potential explanations for the chlorophyll deficit, including lack of light due to persistent cloud cover, deep mixing layers, fast ocean currents, and the likelihood that blooms, while extant, might not develop on the surface. None of these possibilities can be confirmed at this stage.},

These major contributors to the low salinity intermediate water mass are advected northward along the continental slope of South America. The lower density water type enters the Argentine Basin both east and west of Burdwood Bank. Its thermohaline characteristics are modified by winter sea-air interaction near Burdwood Bank and mixing with the surrounding waters further north. The denser water type flows east of Burdwood Bank, undergoing salinity decrease, primarily by isopycnal processes. Low salinity water, derived from the Polar Front, is introduced into a still denser horizon (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}), from along the axis of the cyclonic circulation feature described by the Malvinas Current and its return to the south. The thermohaline structure across the Malvinas Current is similar to the water mass zonation observed in the northern Drake Passage. In the vicinity of 38\textdegree S, the northward-flowing modified subantarctic water converges with subtropical thermocline water at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. The less dense subantarctic water spreads under the subtropical thermocline; however, the denser water (27.25 {$\sigma\theta$}) of Polar Front origin is not found under the subtropical thermocline in the western South Atlantic. In general the salinity at the salinity minimum increases rapidly across the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, suggesting that the bulk of the subantarctic water advected into the region by the Malvinas Current turns towards the interior, spreading under the subtropical thermocline along a broader expanse of the South Atlantic.},

This contribution represents the most recent and complete checklist of benthic organisms (mainly mega and macrofauna) that summarized 240 taxa collected at three sites in the mentioned area. The benthic richness here documented largely exceeds the values coming from other productive areas in Argentinean waters. Faunistic composition was different among the sites, although several species were shared. Bryozoans presented the highest richness compared to the other groups, followed by mollusks and sponges. These data represent valuable information and a very helpful starting point for incoming research, conservation efforts and management. It is essential to establish the spatial distribution of indicator taxa, like corals, sponges and bryozoans, to better attempt at the protection of benthic biodiversity in this rich Argentinean marine system. This is a key issue considering the notable extension of the MPA compared to other areas in Argentina, the bathymetric variations, particular oceanographic conditions and different fishing circumstances within the area.},
